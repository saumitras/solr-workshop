When you want to go into &quot;free running&quot; mode, have your software attempt to continuously move the servo into a position that results in the least current consumption. This will not entirely result in a &quot;free running&quot; servo, since there will be some jittery movements from the servo as the software attempts to find the &quot;right&quot; position, but it might work depending on your application.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You would not need to modify your servos to monitor current consumption.

It usually looks clumsy, and doesn't really take into account the delicacy of walking over uneven terrain. Walking this way tends to be jerky since one tripod is reaching the end of its travel just as the next tripod is touching down. Exactly how smooth you can make the walk depends on the implementation of your robot. If you have 3 degrees of freedom on each leg, then you have great freedom bring one set of legs forward quickly, bring them carefully into contact with the ground, matching the motion of the ground, and gently taking the robot's weight on them before lifting the other tripod. Alternatively, if you have two fixed tripods, the robot is going to just clunk along like a toy. It also has the lowest payload carrying capacity, since only three legs are on the ground. However, it can be pretty fast, since you're moving three legs at once.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ripple&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;This is by far my preferred gait. What I like about this gait is that it's easier to make the walk smoother. At any one time, you have three legs taking the weight, one in flight, one touching down, and one lifting off. It also makes it easier to cope with rough terrain. When the terrain is rough, you may need a moment longer to touch the leg down carefully on the ground, begin to apply weight and see if it's stable. If so, take the weight fully, and continue walking. If not, then it's not a disaster to delay lifting another leg so that you can try to get this one stable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="40" LastActivityDate="2012-10-23T20:08:02.520" CommentCount="1" />

It helps to reign back a very high proportional term and limit runaway acceleration when you are far from your destination, but it can also help increase the speed at which you converge on your destination when you get close to it and the proportional term contributes much less.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are using a velocity controller rather than a torque controller then the derivative term may actually be hidden inside your speed controller and not directly accessible to your PID loop. This can make control simpler (typically it will just accelerate as quickly as it can up to the desired speed or maximum speed, whichever is lower) but it can also make it less predictable. Often an overly aggressive D (or P) term can result in getting into a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_cycle&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;limit cycle&lt;/a&gt; (often incorrectly called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_resonance&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;resonance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;oscillation&lt;/a&gt; due to the sound of the motors humming or even screaming in this state, though &lt;em&gt;limit-cycle&lt;/em&gt; is a much more accurate description).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The integral term is there to correct for residual &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller#Integral_term&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;steady-state error&lt;/a&gt;, that is where there is a persistent, long term difference between where you are being asked to go and where you actually are. Your current &lt;code&gt;correction&lt;/code&gt; (really just tolerance) value works like the opposite of an integral term, it cuts the motor entirely when you are within a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadband&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;deadband&lt;/a&gt; around the desired position.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Due to these factors, you will gain little from implementing a full PID loop unless you also plan in a velocity profile with a distinct accelerate, cruise &amp;amp; decelerate phases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also bear in mind that the deadband and lack of I term will mean that the final position will always be somewhat random and will most likely differ depending on which direction you approach the desired position. As such, your bi-directional repeatability could be much worse than your standard repeatability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For more information on the difference between accuracy, repeatability and resolution, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.me.mtu.edu/~microweb/chap2/ch2-1.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this excellent description&lt;/a&gt;.

I.E. one which you can freely rotate by applying an external torque. It is certainly possible to create these, and they are used on many robots, but most RC servos require considerable torque to back drive them. I would call them semi-backdrivable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What prevents you back driving them? Two things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friction:&lt;/strong&gt; Firstly, friction in the gear chain and motor. RC servos are always geared down; the output spins slower than the motor. Of course this means that when you try to back drive it, you have to spin the motor very quickly. Any friction or cogging in the motor will be felt dozens of time over at the output.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/KFZwV.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;backdrivability&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current:&lt;/strong&gt; something surprising about electric motors is that, if you short the terminals, they become harder to turn. The rotation of the motor generates an electric current which works against your rotation. The electronics inside the servo might well allow enough current to flow, even when off, that it noticeably prevents backdrivability. In the past I have noticed that some large stepper motors, even when ungeared, are almost impossible to back drive when plugged in to unpowered equipment. But when you unplug them, they can be spun freely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, one way you can improve the back-drivability is to prevent current flowing. The obvious way to do this is to fully disconnect the motor from its electronics. But this is hard to do, even using FETs, because the diodes inside the FETs might well allow current to flow. However, you could use a relay, which really would disconnect the motor. You'd only have to use it on one of the motor's terminals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/9Yv1Y.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Maxon's ESCON&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;'Proper' servo controllers (like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://escon.maxonmotor.com/&quot;&gt;ESCON&lt;/a&gt; from Maxon) actually contain a current controller which can actively prevent current flowing by applying the correct voltage at the motor terminals. Replacing the electronics in the servo with something capable of current control might really help.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you should do:&lt;/strong&gt; Open up the servo, unsolder the motor, and re-assemble it. How easy is it to back-drive now? If it's easy, then it may be possible to do what you want. If it's still too hard for your application, then you're going to have to choose a different servo, or make your own. Make one with a single gear stage so that the gear friction is reduced as much as possible, and use drive electronics with a current control loop to guarantee zero current flow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="40" LastActivityDate="2012-10-23T22:29:05.897" CommentCount="1" />

At some point the motor will become worn enough that you will be unable to tune the PID parameters to give you the performance you need.Before this happens though you may already have started tripping a torque limit in your motion controller (it may not allow 100% toque for more than n ms for instance).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem with looking just at torque is that it can be difficult to keep track of, just looking at the max value will tell you nothing because many situations can cause 100% torque for short periods, especially with an aggressively tuned PID controller.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As it is constantly changing, setting up monitoring could easily be too lenient (resulting in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors#False_negative_error&quot;&gt;false negatives&lt;/a&gt;) or too strict (resulting in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors#False_positive_error&quot;&gt;false positives&lt;/a&gt;). This is why you probably want something closer to an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square&quot;&gt;RMS&lt;/a&gt; of the torque which you monitor over a long period and look at the trends.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another tool to look for failing motors is somewhat easier to use and that's the maximum &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newport.com/Control-Theory-Terminology/178319/1033/content.aspx&quot;&gt;following error&lt;/a&gt; over a move. This is the maximum difference between where the motor was supposed to be and where it actually was at any point during the move. It is a single value for the whole move and is something that many motion controllers keep track of for their own use. In fact, many have soft limits on maximum following error and error if you exceed them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, tripping a max follow error can just be an indication that you just need to retune your PID loop, but the frequency with which you need to retune your PID and the difficulty you have in achieving your desired performance can be valuable tools in determining when a motor is getting to the end of it's life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="37" LastActivityDate="2012-10-23T23:19:47.083" />

If you look at any of the application lists for SMAs, you'll almost never see a robotic application on the list.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most SMA applications are non-actuated, and include things like glasses frames and golf clubs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some applications do use the SMA as an actuator, but usually only once or twice. These are applications like medical stents, which need to be inserted into an artery small, but open up once inside.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason there are no robotic applications where the SMA needs to act as an actuator and exert a force cause something to move, is that it's subject to fatigue. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape-memory_alloy#Fatigue_and_functional_fatigue&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;SMA is subject to fatigue; a failure mode by which cyclic loading results in the initiation and propagation of a crack that eventually results in catastrophic loss of function by fracture.&#xA;  in addition to this failure mode, which is not exclusively observed in smart materials. SMA are also subject to Functional Fatigue, whereby the SMA does not fail structurally, but, due to a combination of applied stress, and/or temperature, loses (to some degree) its ability to undergo a reversible phase transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But if you insist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because SMA undergoes creep and fatigue, you will &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to have some kind of force transducer and control system to make sure you're applying a known force.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I would suggest&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Rather than SMAs, there are many small actuators which can satisfy your constraints without the huge drawbacks of SMA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voice Coils:&lt;/strong&gt; These simply consist of a permanent magnet and a coil.

This generally depends on the weight of the robot, and the power of the motors (speed at which the robot moves).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, a 1kg robot is too light to cause much damage. Conversely if it is 50kg, it could cause some damage. Similarly, a 5kg flying robot which moves very quickly could be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You will want to mount an emergency stop on the robot, and possibly also another one off the robot (although this is a more difficult configuration). The safe way of wiring an emergency stop is in a normally closed manner. That means that the switch is normally closed, and the two terminals are connected. By connecting one end to logical 1, and pulling the other end to logical 0 through a resistor, it can be used to determine the state of the emergency stop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the emergency stop is triggered, the switch will open, and the signal will be pulled to logical 0 (0 volts).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This will normally feed into a relay controlling the power to the robot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that another safety requirement of emergency stops is that resetting an emergency stop should not start up the robot again. Turning it back on should require both resetting the emergency stop, and subsequently pressing the on switch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EHow has a diagram showing how this should be wired:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ehow.com/how-does_5151421_do-emergency-stop-buttons-work.html&quot;&gt;http://www.ehow.com/how-does_5151421_do-emergency-stop-buttons-work.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;http://robotics.stackexchange.com/a/116/145&quot;&gt;Mark Booth&lt;/a&gt; pointed out, to further increase robustness, you should use the normally open switch as well. To do this, connect this signal (with a pull down resistor), to the STOP signal of a relay (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_logic&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_logic&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The systems that should be killed should include all actuators. This means anything that can move. If you have a computer on board, you may be able to separate its power to another system to avoid sudden loss of power. However, you will want to ensure that it is not powering any actuators directly (eg. USB).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For low power applications, you might try to save on space by skipping the relay, and wire the emergency stop in series with your main power source (batteries). &lt;strong&gt;Don't do this.&lt;/strong&gt; There are two problems:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This would violate the safety principle that resetting the emergency stop should &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; by itself turn on the power again.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;All the current will be flow through your emergency stop.

It includes an internal Kalman filter to estimate pitch, roll and yaw (using magnetic sensors), and you can tune the gains on the Kalman filter yourself. How they should be tuned will depend on your application (eg. vibration, usual rates of rotation and acceleration).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My experience is that it is easily within 1 degree accuracy, and if tuned well, can be almost 0.1 degree accuracy. Having said that, it requires the use of the active tuning parameter (depending on how far acceleration differs from gravity). While I have looked closely at the angular position data, I have not specifically investigated the accuracy of the acceleration or angular rate data (although I have some data, but I used encoders as a ground truth, and differentiation makes the encoder data too noisy to compare).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Things you might want to consider:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is definitely a bonus to be able to tune the Kalman filter gains.

A change in the time delay&#xA;  affects the phase angle, but not the amplitude ratio. For example, an&#xA;  increase in the time delay makes the phase shift more negative for any&#xA;  given frequency. A change in the time constant changes both the&#xA;  amplitude ratio and the phase angle. For example, an increase in the&#xA;  time constant will decrease the amplitude ratio and make the phase lag&#xA;  more negative at any given frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then you will need to determine the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goddardconsulting.ca/pid-control.html&quot;&gt;cross-over frequency&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The proportional term moves the magnitude of the frequency response of&#xA;  the open loop up or down and hence is used to set the cross-over&#xA;  frequency of the open loop. The cross-over frequency is the frequency&#xA;  at which the magnitude has a gain of 1 (or 0dB). This frequency is&#xA;  important as it is closely related to bandwidth of the closed loop&#xA;  response.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In an ideal system the proportional gain could be made (almost)&#xA;  infinitely large leading to an infinitely fast, yet still stable,&#xA;  closed loop. In practice that is not the case. Rather, two design&#xA;  rules of thumb come into play.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Firstly the sample rate of the digital hardware on which the&#xA;  controller is going to be executed needs to be considered. &lt;strong&gt;A typical&#xA;  rule of thumb is that the cross-over frequency should be set to be at&#xA;  least 10 times lower than the sample rate of the controller.&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;  Conceptually this ensures that the controller is running at a fast&#xA;  enough rate that it can adequately handle changes in the signal being&#xA;  controlled.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The second rule of thumb is related to the slope of the frequency&#xA;  response at the cross-over frequency. If the roll-off of the open-loop&#xA;  magnitude response at cross-over can be made to be close to&#xA;  -20dB/decade then the closed-loop bandwidth can be expected to be close to the cross-over frequency. Note that the integral and&#xA;  derivative terms, not just the proportional term, are used to control&#xA;  the slope at cross-over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/yU7CW.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bode cross-over graph&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(emphasis mine)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the optimal control loop frequency should be around 10 times that of the cross-over frequency of your system's phase delay which can be obtained through empirical test data or, ideally, computer simulation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="142" LastActivityDate="2012-10-26T15:38:04.407" CommentCount="7" />

It's simply a tube stuffed with grease. The grease prevents any water leaking into the boat between the tube and the propeller shaft.

The ends of the tube have loose bushings fitted which hardly contribute any friction, but prevent the grease escaping.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This will probably work well even for fully submersible vehicles, as long as they don't go too deep. As you go deeper, the pressure will begin to force water up the tube, pushing the grease out, and eventually letting water into the boat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One way to combat this is to simply push back. Increase the air pressure at the other end of the stuffing box so that things stay balanced. One way to do this is to enclose the motor and the inside end of the tube inside a small sealed box.

Also, profile your usage to see what data you have coming in when.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you have a higher level retry protocol on your serial comms, then when you are overloaded perhaps you could drop incoming serial bytes, leaving it to the retry mechanism to catch up when the CPU has the time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you can do this then you are going to want to fail early. When your serial buffer is full, there is no point reading the data from the uart, writing it into your buffer, overwriting existing data - that's just wasting cycles which could be used elsewhere (you are going to have to throw away the partial serial stream anyway). When you experience a serial buffer overrun, just clear the uart without reading it, leave the buffer in it's old state and return, letting the CPU get on with things it can complete successfully.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you could disable interrupts entirely for low priority events.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Profiling your usage can also be very valuable. Lets say you have four 16 byte buffers where one is constantly going into an overrun condition because you are sending 36 byte packets to it, but where the other 3 never have more than 5 or 6 bytes in them at once. In this case it is worth rewriting your buffer code to allow different sized buffers.

Could you split that processing up and do several shorter processes rather than one long process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance, if your interrupts normally take up 70% of your CPU and another routine takes up 20% &lt;em&gt;on average&lt;/em&gt;, but only needs 10% some of the time and runs out of CPU at others, then breaking up that processing into more predictable, repeatable blocks could be worthwhile, even if it takes more processing power power overall.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, if you don't have a higher level retry mechanism, consider implementing one, this would enable low level prioritisation which might otherwise not be possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, learn how to optimise for your hardware.

This problem in isolation is called localization, and there are many ways to perform that. Firstly you will have to differentiate between relative methods, so measurements which provide a change in position to a previously known position. This method has the problem, that any errors are obviously accumulated, and will grow unbounded. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dead reckoning is likely one of the oldest ways of relative localization. If you use heading, speed and time (so estimating the distance traveled) you can sum up you position changes from a starting position. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to using dead reckoning you can also not landmarks and track them in a map. Finding those landmarks again will allow you to reduce your relative position error. This is the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem. It is still relative navigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now coming to your actual question on absolute navigation. All that GPS does is provide you with distance estimations to Landmarks with a known position information in your reference frame (in this case geocentric). GPS receivers will take these information and generate a position solution, which also has an error. The good thing though is that this error is bounded within your frame of reference. This it what makes it an absolute positioning system. So whether its indoors or outdoors and regardless of your desired reference frame, all you need for absolute positioning systems are measurements that put you in relation to some known landmark position within your reference frames. Some of those methods have been given in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://robotics.stackexchange.com/a/173/127&quot;&gt;previous answer&lt;/a&gt;. Although, as I said, SLAM is not an absolute method. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simplest form is direct landmark recognition. If you see an Eiffel-Tower you should have a good notion of your absolute position (at least with an absolute error bound) within the earth fixed frame (if you know the position of the Eiffel-Tower). You may have to do some &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Las_Vegas&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;disambiguation&lt;/a&gt;, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to improve your absolute position error, you can use multiple landmarks at the same time. Classical &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Triangulation&lt;/a&gt; is such an example. Another one is using craters for a lunar descent vehicle. Landmarks don't have to be visual, and you can use things like RF signal strength for known signals like in WiFi or Cellular localization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the above methods needed landmarks, which need to be identified and uniquely associated. If this is a problem, you can also use different methods, like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.control.isy.liu.se/research/reports/2001/2333.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;terrain profile&lt;/a&gt;.

For servos, you need good response time so that you can handle the pulses. If you have a PWM-capable channel, this shouldn't be hard as the channel has a high baud already.

If the information is multi-dimensional (e.g. force values from multiple sensors), it might be the case that some dimensions (e.g. sensor reads) do not contain useful discriminative information; in this case, compress the data with Principal Component Analysis so that you will have more compact features during training and classification.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, with regard to your question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The difference is that HMMs can represent each of your texture classes with several hidden variables/states, thus capturing the internal temporal evolution of each contact. We can say that HMM better model the &quot;low-level&quot; (intra-class) dynamics of your data. For example, in your case HMMs will permit you to explicitly model three different phases of each data acquisition: (1) start of contact between robot and object; (2) stable part of the contact; (3) end of contact and release. These phases could have different values in time, even for the same object texture, and it could make sense to separate them to improve classification results.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, CRFs are more suited for capturing the &quot;high-level&quot; (inter-class) relations of your data distribution, which are sometimes important when the spatio-temporal variability is high, or when the observation features are very similar between two samples belonging to different classes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally I find HMMs easier to use and I would start with those, but your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If I decide to classify into more categories and the distinction between each of are categories are very subtle, in that case what would be a good choice?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In that case, CRFs can be a more robust choice (see above).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Will force-data be sufficient to capture all the information I need to classify textures into these categories?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Adding visual features (object appearance), especially if captured with high-resolution cameras, could help determine if the object has a rough texture or not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="197" LastActivityDate="2012-10-29T14:13:20.547" CommentCount="2" />

In short it is a control methodology that presumes the model is known but the parameters of the model (mass, inertia, etc.) are not. It's job is to estimate the unknown parameters. A brief introduction can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_control&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.

It is the job of the adaptive controller to estimate these parameters. You do have to give it an initial guess for each of the unknown parameters however. Then as the system runs it uses the control signals, the output signals, and a method like linear regression or gradient descent to update the unknown parameter values. Over time the parameters will converge to values that will result in a steady-state though they may not match the real parameters, i.e. it may get the mass wrong, but the value will still work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From here I would advise referring to a text that discusses the method.

Increasing the size of the buffer only briefly delays the problem, and sending smaller packets (but more of them) will probably only make things worse.&#xA;A real-time system &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; process incoming data at least as fast as that data can come in;&#xA;otherwise the &lt;strong&gt;processor overload&lt;/strong&gt; will only make the processor get further and further behind.&#xA;Is there some way your status debug system could detect and signal this sort of overflow?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this overflow only happens rarely, perhaps the simplest &quot;solution&quot; (arguably merely a hack) is to handle it in more-or-less the same way you would handle a (hopefully rare) power glitch or loss-of-signal on a radio connection: when an overflow is detected, have the AVR erase the entire buffer and pretend it never received those bytes. Most modern protocols are carefully designed such that, if any packet is lost, the system will eventually re-sync and correctly handle future packets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To really fix this problem requires somehow making the &quot;time to process a packet&quot; less than &quot;time from the end of one packet to the end of the next packet&quot;.&#xA;so you must either&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;reduce the bit rate.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;modify the sender to give the AVR more time to process a packet -- perhaps unconditionally send 50 additional &quot;dummy bytes&quot; in the packet preamble -- or however many is needed to give the AVR more than enough time to completely process the last packet and get ready for the next packet.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;decrease the time to process a packet&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;or some combination.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The wall-clock time to process a packet involves both the time the AVR spends in actually processing the packet,&#xA;and also the time the AVR spends doing &quot;other stuff&quot; such as dealing with all the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; I/O ports and interrupt handlers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some methods of decreasing the time to actually process a packet are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes it's faster to copy the packet out of the queue into some other buffer for further processing, removing it from the circular queue. It makes the packet-handler simpler if the packet starts at the beginning of that other buffer, so key parts of the packet are a fixed constant offset from the beginning of that buffer. (This has the advantage of making it impossible for the serial interrupt handler, which only writes into the circular queue, to accidentally corrupt that packet after it's been copied to that other buffer.)(This approach lets you use tested and &quot;optimized&quot; and known-good functions that handle numbers represented as ASCII strings of hex digits or decimal digits in consecutive order, which may run faster operating on that linear buffer than &quot;equivalent&quot; functions that also have to deal with the wrap-around split of a circular buffer). This requires both the queue and the other buffer to each be at least the size of the maximum possible packet.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes it's faster to leave the packet in the queue while parsing it and remove it from the queue only after the packet handler is completely done with it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes a pair of &quot;ping-pong&quot; buffers is faster than a circular queue.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Many systems use only a single buffer large enough for the largest possible valid packet, and completely disable interrupts from that port until the interrupt handler has finished with the last packet and is ready for the next packet.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;somehow actually do less work per packet.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More general approaches to dealing with situations where &quot;other stuff&quot; is eating so much time that there's not enough time to deal with the packet in the buffer (and may also help reduce the time to actually process the packet):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;if you're lucky, you can find some algorithmic tweaks to effectively do the same work in fewer cycles.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;load-shedding: do less important stuff less often; or perhaps don't do them at all in times of heavy load. (As implemented in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Guidance_Computer#PGNCS_trouble&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Apollo 11 AGC&lt;/a&gt; ).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;yield() more often: if your main loop does fair round-robin cycling between &quot;if we have a complete packet from port 1, handle it&quot; and &quot;if we have a complete packet from port 2, handle it&quot;, and the packet parser for either one takes so long that the buffer for the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; port overflows, it may help to break the packet parser up into shorter pieces and do only a little processing each time through the main loop, giving the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; packet parser a chance to deal with packets before its buffer overflows. Perhaps even consider switching to a pre-emptive task scheduler or a full-up RTOS.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;yield() less often: sometimes a processor spends more time in &quot;task switching&quot; or &quot;multitasking overhead&quot; than actually doing anything productive.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Reduce the time spent processing interrupt handlers. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/papers/lctes05/regehr-lctes05.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Preventing Interrupt Overload&lt;/a&gt; ). High-frequency pulses on one interrupt line can pause main loop tasks indefinitely. It may be necessary to program each low-priority interrupt handler to recognize high-load situations and completely disable its own particular interrupt before re-enabling global interrupts at its return-from-interrupt instruction, and have the main loop recognize low-load situations and re-enable those interrupts.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;increase the clock rate of the processor.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;switch to a more powerful processor. A &quot;more powerful&quot; processor is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the same as &quot;a processor with a faster clock rate&quot;. You might be able to find a processor that does the same work in &lt;em&gt;fewer&lt;/em&gt; cycles than your particular 8-bit AVR -- perhaps some other AVR with specialized peripherals that do work in hardware that you're currently doing in software, freeing up software cycles for other things; or perhaps a 32-bit processor that can do certain tasks in software in fewer cycles than any 8-bit processor.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Occasionally in robotics &quot;one big fast processor&quot; is better than lots of little processors: the amount of code and the communication latency to copy a message from one task to another task on the same processor is always much less than to copy that same message from one task to another task on some other processor.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Often in robotics it makes things simpler and more &quot;provably correct&quot; to add more processors, perhaps one processor per leg or even &lt;a href=&quot;http://openservo.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;one processor per servo&lt;/a&gt;.

I can arbitrarily increase these buffers or create my own larger circular buffer, but I would like to have a more methodical approach to determining appropriate size requirements and/or the minimal amount of time I can wait before pulling bytes out of the serial port driver buffer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At 1st glance:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;115200 == 115.2 bits per millisecond == ~12.8 bytes per millisecond (assuming 1 stop bit)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Is that a valid way to calculate timing for serial transmissions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, given my specific setup:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;PC Program &amp;lt;--&gt; Bluetooth Serial Profile Driver &amp;lt;--&gt; Bluetooth Transceiver &amp;lt;-&lt;em&gt;*&lt;/em&gt;-&gt; BlueSMIRF Wireless Modem &amp;lt;--&gt; Parallax Propellor Program&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) What is the maximum amount of data I can send for a given period of time consistently without eventually running in to problems?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe I'm over complicating things, but it seems like there are potentially multiple buffers involved in the transmission chain above.  How do others commonly deal with this? Do they throttle the PC sending to a known safe rate? Implement flow control?  If implementing flow control, how does that affect bandwidth and response times?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(If it matters, my experiment is to use a joystick on the PC to control multiple servos with instant reaction to the joystick movements. So every small movement of the joystick results in multiple commands being sent to the microcontroller. The commands are not just simple positional commands though, they also involve acceleration/deacceleration of servos over time and this is the reason that the microcontroller spends a significant amount of clock cycles before processing new bytes.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="167" LastActivityDate="2012-11-21T17:41:00.177" Title="How to calculate serial speed and buffer requirements for PC to microcontroller communications?"

However&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first obvious thing to say is that downstream devices must be capable of dealing with the flow of data, both in the long term and in the short term. In the short term, devices use buffering to cope with the flow. In the long term, the need processing power to act on the data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One problem you have is that you don't control all of the steps in your chain, so if one of them is causing delays, there might not be much you can do about it, short of replacing it. Hoever, I'd have thought that the Bluetooth serial driver would have a nice big buffer, and would play nice with the transceiver and BlueSMIRF, so it's probably safe to ignore them. I guess the real problem is between the Propeller and the PC.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What seems to be happening in your case is that the interaction between the data producer and the consumer is producing unpredictable queue lengths, and you would like to apply some proper theory to that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, studies have been done on exactly this problem with regards to queuing at restaurants, E.G. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ipedr.com/vol6/11-A00030.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Case Study for Restaurant Queuing Model&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/laurens.debo/Research/Papers/Debo-Veeraraghavan-Sputtering-Equilibria-July-2012.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Equilibrium in Queues under Unknown Service Times and Service Value&lt;/a&gt;.

The goal is to energize the coils in sequence so that the shaft of the motor (and its magnet) rotates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two magnetic fields that are important here, the field of the rotor (rotating magnet) and the field of the stator (static coils):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/NahC8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;field vectors&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We refer to the direction of the magnetic field as its &quot;flux vector&quot; because it sounds super cool.  The most important thing to learn from this image is that you want the two magnetic fields to be at right angles to each other.  This maximizes efficiency and torque.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The dumbest commutation scheme is trapezoidal.  Using either hall sensors or back EMF from the motor, it is possible to determine if the motor is in one of a discrete number of positions and perform on/off control on one or two coils to lead the magnetic field around the motor:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/TyG7F.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;trapezoid&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because there might only be six separate orientations for the stator field, the flux vector of the motor could be anywhere from 60-120 degrees (instead of the desired 90) and therefore you get torque ripple and poor efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An obvious solution here is to switch to sinusoidal commutation and just smooth out the waveform:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/OzDz0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sin&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you know the exact orientation of the rotor you can just do some trig to calculate the exact PWM duty cycle to apply to each coil in order to keep the flux vector at 90 degrees and bam you have a beautiful 90 degree flux vector.  (The rotor orientation can be determined via encoder, interpolation or more advanced estimation such as a kalman filter).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So right now you might be wondering how you can do better than sinusoidal commutation.  The key flaw of sinusoidal commutation is that the outputs are sent straight to PWM.  Because of coil inductance, the current (and therefore flux vector) will lag behind the commanded values and as the motor approaches its top speed the flux vector will be at 80 or 70 degrees instead of 90.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is why sinusoidal commutation has poor high speed performance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This finally brings us to flux-vector control which is a name given to (often proprietary) control algorithms that attempt to ensure the magnetic flux stays at 90 degrees even at high speeds.  The simplest way to do this would be to lead the field by, for example, 90-120 degrees depending on how fast you are going, knowing that the actual magnetic flux will lag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More robust solutions involve PID/feedforward to accurately control the current going through each phase.  Every servo manufacturer has their own in-house algorithm so I am sure there is some pretty complicated stuff at the bleeding edge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To put it in simplest terms, flux vector control is sinusoidal control of the current going to each phase (instead of just the PWM duty cycle).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The line between sinusoidal/flux vector is pretty vague since some companies perform advanced control on their &quot;sinusoidal&quot; drives (which essentially makes them flux vector).

I don't know of any theorem for this, though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, note that &quot;bigger batteries&quot; doesn't mean &quot;bigger motors&quot;. And &quot;bigger motors&quot; doesn't mean &quot;stronger motors&quot; or &quot;more powerful motors&quot;. If we're talking about the same type of battery, then we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; say that a bigger battery is generally more powerful{*}. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing the weight of the bot changes a lot is the friction. See, with a heavy bot, friction increases proportionately. This means we need proportionally stronger motor to be able to climb inclines (otherwise the bot just gets stuck, or starts rolling down). The friction doesn't really make a difference while moving on a flat surface, though. This is an easy principle to put down on paper--for a given weight increase, we need a proportional increase in torque. To obtain that, we may either use a motorwith a proportionately lower rpm (but that reduces the speed), or use a proportionately more powerful battery.  So in the end, this evens out nicely, since the power of a battery depends upon its size, keeping the type fixed. When the bot is moving on a flat surface, its inertia needs to be counteracted whenever one wants to turn. For this, we need high friction (which we already have), and a proportionately stronger motor. Again, this evens out nicely, So really, we should look at the power requirements of the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; components and choose size/power, and the motors will take care of themselves (I don't mean you neglect the motors entirely, I'm just saying that the motor issue is easily straightened out after the bot size has been decided. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another thing a larger size gives you is more capacity to store energy. You can always stuff some extra Li-Po's on a large (autonomous or RC) bot , and increase its lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Due to all this, it's really saner to just say that the size/weight of the bot has no direct relation to its effectiveness. It really depends on what the bot is supposed to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;.  There are just too many other factors to decide--you need to know what strength you want, what power auxiliary mechanisms need, if the auxiliary mechanisms need couterbalancing, the maximum angle incline the bot is subject to, required stability, required response time, lifetime, etc. Choosing a size/weight requires one take all these factors into account while designing the bot. Some bots are better designed small, some bots are better designed large. No formula to it :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*On the other hand, one can replace a Pb-acid battery with a bunch of Li-Po batteries of the same net weight and size, and get a much powerful &quot;battery&quot;. &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="126" LastActivityDate="2012-11-03T16:42:52.827" />

These could be low performance, low accuracy, high force actuators such as a lead screw with a servo or stepper drive (force and performance can be traded but accuracy will always be limited by backlash), all the way up to high performance, high accuracy direct drive linear motors with precision encoders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The remaining 3DOF manipulator will usually require precision rotational motion for pitch, roll and yaw, so usually an electric motor (either stepper or servo), will be most suitable. Even a small motor with a reasonably high gearing can resist gravity against quite high loads.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;An aside on servo motors vs. stepper motors&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The difference between servo&lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt; and stepper is a tradeoff between complexity and certainty in control.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;# Note that my experience is with industrial &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servomechanism#Servomotor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;servos&lt;/a&gt;, typically a brushed or brushless DC motors with a rotary encoder, so this may or may not apply with hobby &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servomechanism#RC_servos&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;RC servos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A servo motor requires an encoder for position feedback, whereas a stepper doesn't. This means that a stepper is electrically &lt;em&gt;much simpler&lt;/em&gt;, and from a control point of view simpler if you want low performance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to get the most out of your motor though (pushing it close to it's limit), then steppers get &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more difficult to control predictably. With position feedback on a servo you can tune performance &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more aggressively and since you know if it fails to reach it's target position or velocity then your servo loop will get to find out about it and correct it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With a stepper you have to tune the system so that you can &lt;em&gt;guarantee&lt;/em&gt; that it can &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; make the step, irrespective of the desired speed of move or weight of the payload. Note that some people will suggest adding an encoder to detect missed steps on a stepper motor, but if you are going to do that then you might as well have used a servo motor in the first place!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;SCARA arm&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With a SCARA arm, the Z axis is probably the only linear axis, while the remaining axes can all be done with rotational motor, so again stepper or servo motor. Sizing these motors is relatively easy because the weight carried is less important to many of them. The motor required to overcome the inertia of a load is rather less than sizing it to overcome gravity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Articulated arm&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With an articulated arm the calculations are more tricky, because most axes will need actuators sized depending on both moving the load and lifting it, but again an electric motor is the easiest to control and use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The gripper&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally there is the gripper.

I saw the range of 0-5m, but if you're suggesting that they might touch, or just barely not touch, then you're going to have difficulties. Lightweight is also a vague term which will need to be defined better in order to adequately answer your question. Still, there are some things to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Augmented GPS can get you sub-inch accuracy. This will likely involve an extra antenna, so space and weight might be a concern. You also have to make sure you don't lose GPS accuracy at the wrong time, which I've seen with some systems.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As geez suggests, IMU is very useful for the 6-DOF tracking.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You almost certainly know this, but 3D movement makes this a tricky problem. Avoiding collisions is &lt;em&gt;relatively&lt;/em&gt; easy, but ensuring the proper formation between the two means sensing the other vehicle will require a wide range of detection.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A sensor such as MS's Kinect will get you some around .6m to 3m 3D sensing, but in a relatively narrow cone, so you'd need several to cover the all around the planes. Also, they're not all &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; fast and will have trouble in difficult weather. Most weather, really. I don't know of any variants that are outdoor rated, especially in cold/damp (condensation on a lens would kill that sensor).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Which also brings me to another question: speed. Planes are all reasonably fast, but there's glider fast and there's supersonic jet fast and all ranges in between. Refresh rate vs. distance between UAVs will be a very important consideration. Is 30-60hz enough time for your UAVs to correct when they're a few meters apart, or do they need something close to 100hz?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If 30-60Hz is enough, you could potentially mark your UAVs with a distinctive pattern and use optics to detect that pattern and, combined with GPS etc, use that for close-range stuff. The problem with straight image detection is that it's computationally intensive and sometimes tricky to do, especially depending on your math skills. You'd have to have a way to keep the lens clear of condensation, like the Kinect, but I don't believe that's an intractable problem in this case, because you have a lot of options on cameras. Not saying it'd be easy, but easier than with a Kinect-style sensor.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;XBee is cool, but it's all packet based, so there's a maximum refresh rate on transmitting between units. You'd probably need some tolerance on lost packets, as well.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, no sure answers yet, but possibly with some domain narrowing we could help you more. Size, weight, minimum distance, and maximum speed limits will all wildly affect what solution you might go with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;UPDATE based on additional information:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hmmm. I don't think there's an ideal solution. An array of ultrasonics could get you collision avoidance, but there's no high-refresh rate 3D sensor that I know of that could make a bubble around your plane in the 0-5m range. If you were scaling up, you could use something like a Velodyne laser to do something like the equivalent, but environmental conditions would make that less than ideal without work on the software end.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Think hard about tolerances. Is it vital they be able to fly within X cm of wingtip to wingtip? Do they need to be coplanar, or would it be okay if one were, for example, +/- a meter above the other as long as they don't collide?

Having done that, you then rotate each joint by an amount proportional to the benefit it gives. Then you do that over and over again until you're close enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally, this is known as gradient following, or hill following.

Rotating joint &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; a tiny bit moves the end point in direction &lt;strong&gt;b&lt;/strong&gt;.  Both of these move us closer to the target by about the same amount, so we should rotate both joints at about the same speed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we were to plot a graph of the distance to the target versus joint angles, it would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/t2Nv5.gif&quot; alt=&quot;IK&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have coloured in some contours just to help.

However, in real space, you would see the end point taking a fairly straight line to the target. You can also see that there are actually two solutions to the problem, and the algorithm has just found the closest one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not the only way to solve the inverse kinematics problem.

Keep in mind that even with a Raspberry Pi, once you add in the charger, wifi adapter, storage card, and cables you're creeping up closer to 100 dollars than 35 dollars so imho the Nexus 7 is a much better deal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, don't try and output a 1 khz signal out of a non real time OS.  Attach yourself a cheap microcontroller like the PJRC Teensy (Arduino clone) and let it handle the simple real time tasks for you.  This way you dedicate the inexpensive CPU to these simple time sensitive tasks.  At 16 MHz with support for multiple timers, a little AVR MCU can handle a half dozen tasks like this without issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="35" LastActivityDate="2012-11-08T13:17:03.553" CommentCount="1" />

Since you are asking for the learning algorithms, I asume your hardware is or will be up and running. When getting your robot to learn, you should differentiate between on-line and off-line learning. Further, there is on-system and off-sytem learning, which can be combined with the previous category. Since your system only has a micro-controller attached to it, your method of choice would be off-system. You learn (be it on-line or off-line) on your connected PC, but not on the system. The system will just execute your current learned policy. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All gait movements have some sort of cyclic nature, and can generally be described as functions that provide an angular value over time for each of the joints. The trick is to parametrize these functions that you come out with as little parameters as possible. Then you perform optimization on these functions. In order to do that you need to know what to optimize for. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most learning approaches will require some sort of reward function, so effectively some feedback to the algorithm to tell it how well it does perform (e.g. maximise distance travelled/energy required). The algorithm will then want to see the reward for a given set of parameters (single episode). Depending on the complexity of your problem, the number of episodes might be quite large. This is where the destinction between on-line and off-line learning comes in. In off-line learning you use a simulation to perform the learning and then later move it to the system. In on-line learning you learn directly on the system. This is generally more difficult, since you will have to spend a lot of time performing evaluations for the learning algorithm. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="127" LastActivityDate="2012-11-09T07:42:09.500" CommentCount="1" />

Your tasks are &lt;code&gt;evade&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;track&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general you would want the robot to track a line. However, if it couldn't detect the line, then it should try to find it. Above all, it should evade obstacles. This gives us the following ordering:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Highest priority: &lt;code&gt;evade&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Then: &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Then: &lt;code&gt;track&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; has higher priority than &lt;code&gt;track&lt;/code&gt; is that, as I mentioned above, you would &lt;code&gt;track&lt;/code&gt; only if &lt;code&gt;evade&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; are unnecessary. If you put &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; below &lt;code&gt;track&lt;/code&gt;, that means you start tracking if there is no obstacle, even if you are not on the line.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now let's look at your implementation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;task find(){&#xA;    if(SensorValue(lightSensor) &amp;gt; threshold){&#xA;            //spiral the robot&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;task track(){&#xA;&#xA;    if(SensorValue(lightSensor) &amp;lt; threshold){&#xA;            //go straight&#xA;    }else{&#xA;                //execute turns to follow the line&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember that we gave &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; a higher priority. Therefore, if the robot cannot sense the &lt;code&gt;lightSensor&lt;/code&gt;, it will go in spiral trying to find the line. Once it does, &lt;code&gt;track&lt;/code&gt; kicks in. As you can see, the &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; condition of &lt;code&gt;track&lt;/code&gt; never happens.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While this works, the robot would move very awkwardly. There is not much you can do about it in fact, given the current build of your robot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although I already answered your question, but here is a simple improvement to your line tracking:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead of one light sensor, use two; &lt;code&gt;ls_left&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ls_right&lt;/code&gt;. Using (at least) two sensors, you can understand whether you are totally out of the track, or about to go out of the track. In the second case, you can easily turn to the proper direction and get back on track.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; task is similar:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;task find(){&#xA;    if (SensorValue(ls_left) &amp;gt; threshold&#xA;        &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Sensorvalue(ls_right) &amp;gt; threshold){&#xA;            //spiral the robot&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That is, you go in spiral only if you don't sense anything at all&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;code&gt;track&lt;/code&gt; task now becomes more efficient:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;task track(){&#xA;&#xA;    if (SensorValue(ls_left) &amp;lt; threshold&#xA;        &amp;amp;&amp;amp; SensorValue(ls_right) &amp;lt; threshold){&#xA;            //go straight&#xA;    } else if (SensorValue(ls_left) &amp;lt; threshold&#xA;        &amp;amp;&amp;amp; SensorValue(ls_right) &amp;gt; threshold){&#xA;            //turn left&#xA;    } else if (SensorValue(ls_left) &amp;gt; threshold&#xA;        &amp;amp;&amp;amp; SensorValue(ls_right) &amp;lt; threshold){&#xA;            //turn right&#xA;    } else {&#xA;            // shouldn't happen, but go on spiral anyway&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, with a matrix of light sensors, you can better judge how badly you are going out of track (i.e. with what angle) and better decide how to get back on track (i.e. with what angular speed).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="158" LastActivityDate="2012-11-09T14:36:48.600" />

You need a buoyancy engine to supply the thrust, wings to direct that thrust, and some ability to change your pitch angle when you change the buoyancy.  So, you'll need to balance the strength of your engine with the drag created by your wings.  At the same time, your wings need to be big enough to convert vertical forces of buoyancy into horizontal motion.  (Generally, the shallower depths you work with, the less power your buoyancy engine will require.)  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Existing Gliders&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a complex problem, and the existing solutions to it vary wildly.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Seaglider&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Seaglider AUV (built at the University of Washington, now owned by iRobot) is shaped to achieve laminar flow.  The antenna attaches at the back, allowing the vehicle to communicate while pointing nose-down at the surface.  It has no external moving parts; all control is done by shifting weight internally.&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.seaglider.washington.edu/graphics/glider-inpieces.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Seaglider, in pieces&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Spray&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Spray Glider (built at Scripps Institute of Oceanography, now owned by Bluefin) is a more cylindrical shape.  The antenna is located in one of the wings, and the vehicle lays on its side on the surface to communicate.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://auvac.org/uploads/configuration/spray.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Spray Glider&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Slocum Gliders&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Slocum gliders go for a cylindrical shape that's more suited to the pressure housing.  They have an electric powered version, but the real magic is in their more modern &quot;thermal glider&quot; -- they take advantage of the fact that pressure increases with depth but temperature decreases with depth to make an engine that requires no (or very little) electrical input.  Like Seaglider, the antenna is in the tail.&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://marine.rutgers.edu/cool/glider/webpage/PartsOfGlider.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Slocum Glider&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Liberdade XRAY&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Liberdade XRAY is shaped like a flying wing and (to my knowledge) is actually the fastest autonomous underwater glider ever made.

Since you do not say what you consider optimal, most people choose a quadratic expression. For example, suppose your current joint angles are given by the vector $\vec{\alpha}$. We can consider minimizing the movement required - with an error $\vec{x} = \vec{\alpha} - \vec{\alpha}_{start}$, you can define a cost function $J=\vec{x}^TQ\vec{x}$ for some matrix $Q$. We normally use a diagonal matrix, but any positive-definite matrix will do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a simplified example with two joint angles, if joint $a$ had a cheaper motor (perhaps closer to end-effector), we might have a cost function of&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$J=\left[\begin{matrix}x_a\\x_b\end{matrix} \right]\left[\begin{matrix}1&amp;amp;0\\0&amp;amp;2\\\end{matrix} \right]\left[\begin{matrix}x_a&amp;amp;x_b\end{matrix} \right]$, ie. movement of joint $b$ is twice as costly as joint $a$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, the kinematic equation is a matrix formula, and in Denavit-Hartenberg notation might be:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$\prod{T_i}=\left[\begin{matrix}1&amp;amp;0&amp;amp;0&amp;amp;x\\0&amp;amp;1&amp;amp;0&amp;amp;y\\0&amp;amp;0&amp;amp;1&amp;amp;z\\0&amp;amp;0&amp;amp;0&amp;amp;1\end{matrix} \right]$, where the right hand side represents the position $(x,y,z)$ and orientation (currently set as zero rotation), given the joint angles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since we do not care about the orientation, and only the position, we can truncate the first 3 columns of the last transformation matrix, and the last row of the first transformation matrix.

Just find a suitable library, and it will solve it for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A non-linear system of equations is more difficult to solve. This is called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_programming&quot;&gt;non-linear programming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, but it is what you have if you have rotating joints.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, in place of matrix equations, you have nonlinear functions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Minimize $f(x)$ subject to $\vec{h}(x) = 0$, $\vec{g}(x) \leq 0$ (re-arrange if necessary to make the RHS of the constraints zero)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The algorithms used to solve this are even more complex, but includes Interior-point, Sequential quadratic programming (SQP), Active-set, Trust-region reflective algorithms. Obviously, the explanation of how these algorithms work is very lengthy, and I will leave it out of the scope of this answer. Suffice it to say, the amount of content on the algorithms used for just quadratic programming could be a whole course by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should just find a library to solve the problem, it would take a long time to code up an efficient implementation, and efficient implementations can handle 100 (or more) variables at a time. For example, if you use MATLAB, then there is documentation on how to use the function &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/constrained-nonlinear-optimization-examples.html#f11071&quot;&gt;fmincon&lt;/a&gt; from the Optimization Toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To solve it online, you might want C++ or other native implementation, for example, NLopt. Do note that this may not be something a microcontroller can solve quickly, and many libraries may have other dependencies which are not easy to use on a microcontroller (since they are intended for a computer).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are not worried about efficiency, and just want something you can code yourself, then assuming there is a function you can call to solve the &lt;strong&gt;inverse kinematic problem&lt;/strong&gt;, you can simply do a gradient descent method. For example, arbitrarily choosing a random starting orientation, solve the inverse problem, then check the cost function. Then you can use perturbation analysis to check how you should vary the orientation. For example, if you check similar orientations around your current orientation (ie. 8 points in a cubic grid), you can get a second order approximation of how the cost function varies in each direction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using the second order approximation (known as a Hessian matrix since it is multivariate - 3-dimensional for orientation), you can find the zero-crossing of the gradient of the cost function (ie. the predicted local minima).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the new predicted orientation, just put it through the inverse solver again, and repeat until the accuracy is sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do note that this will probably not be as efficient, because the inverse kinematic problem itself must be iteratively solved (so you are repeatedly using a function which itself takes a while to solve). Also, the code involved may be less than a fully-fledged optimization algorithm, but it is still quite substantial, and not an insignificant investment of time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using either method (formally solving as a nonlinear program or using the iteratively using a function to solve the inverse problem), the solution may not be optimal if there are multiple local minima. In this case, you can try to find the global minima by using various approaches. Even with a non-linear programming solver, you will be expected to seed it with initial values (eg. joint angles). You can repeatedly run either method with the seed generated in various ways:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;random restart (it is generated randomly)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;grid-based&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;or other custom methods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However do note that if there are many minima, there is no good way to guarantee that you will find the global minima. You can only improve your chances.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="145" LastEditorUserId="145" LastEditDate="2012-11-10T12:11:49.050" LastActivityDate="2012-11-10T12:11:49.050" />

First, do not use tasks - this is NOT what robotC tasks are for. They could be made to work, maybe, maybe not (and you need quite a few changes to even try).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// global variables&#xA;int distance;&#xA;int light;&#xA;&#xA;main() {&#xA;   while (true) {&#xA;   distance = read_distance;&#xA;   light = read_light;&#xA;   if (task1_wantsToRun())&#xA;     task1_run();&#xA;   if (task2_wantsToRun())&#xA;     task2_run();   &#xA;   }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;there is a couple of things here; priority becomes irrelevant. As nice as it seems to have tasks in robotC with priorities, they are not a good choice for subsumption implementation in my experience. For reasons like, priorities are not always honored, tasks can not be interrupted (sometimes) so when a higher priority event occurs, it is not going to react like you expect, robotC only recently became re-entrant, so things like accessing a sensor from more than 1 task may be risky (I2C timing issues), and in some cases it is not (automatically polled sensors).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can add your own priority implementation to the above loop as you get things working, but it really is not needed for starts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your comment &quot;//box the obstruction&quot;  describes a ballistic behavior. Those are a bit tricky to implement using multi-tasking. The simple loop I used makes it a lot easier, and better for starters/learning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other thing I will leave you with, is that subsumption while being neat and appropriate for a lot of things, is not a good way to implement what is better done traditionally. Indeed the 'evade' portion may be a good candidate for subsumption, but honestly your other task should be called 'GoOnAboutYourBusiness'. I say this because you probably do not want to change from searching to following with subsumption. Handle those with traditional programming loops. With a single sensor, - is the light sensed darker or lighter than it was last loop?  if it got darker (assuming black line) keep turning the same direction, if it got lighter turn the other way, if it stayed the same, go straight. You probably need to add some PID and use a steering curve instead of just turning left and right to be smoother.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And yes, multiple sensors help. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mindsensors.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.mindsensors.com/&lt;/a&gt;  - yeah, that's me in the movie currently (11/10/2012)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Update: actual code&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will try this out in a little while, but it compiles and illustrates what I wrote above:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#pragma config(Sensor, S1,     S_LIGHT,        sensorLightActive)&#xA;#pragma config(Sensor, S2,     S_DISTANCE,     sensorSONAR)&#xA;#pragma config(Motor,  motorB,          LEFT,          tmotorNXT, PIDControl, encoder)&#xA;#pragma config(Motor,  motorC,          RIGHT,         tmotorNXT, PIDControl, encoder)&#xA;//*!!Code automatically generated by 'ROBOTC' configuration wizard               !!*//&#xA;&#xA;int distance_value, light_value;&#xA;&#xA;bool evade_wantsToRun()&#xA;{&#xA;    return distance_value &amp;lt; 30;&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;void evade_task()&#xA;{&#xA;    // full stop&#xA;    motor[LEFT] = 0;        &#xA;    // evade the object ballistically (ie in full control)  &#xA;    // turn left, drive&#xA;    nSyncedTurnRatio = 0;&#xA;    motor[LEFT] = -20;&#xA;    Sleep(500);&#xA;    nSyncedTurnRatio = 100;&#xA;    Sleep(1000);&#xA;    // turn right, drive&#xA;    nSyncedTurnRatio = 0;&#xA;    motor[LEFT] = 20;&#xA;    Sleep(500);&#xA;    nSyncedTurnRatio = 100;&#xA;    Sleep(1000);&#xA;    // turn right, drive&#xA;    nSyncedTurnRatio = 0;&#xA;    motor[LEFT] = 20;&#xA;    Sleep(500);&#xA;    nSyncedTurnRatio = 100;&#xA;    Sleep(1000);&#xA;    // turn left, resume&#xA;    nSyncedTurnRatio = 0;&#xA;    motor[LEFT] = 20;&#xA;    Sleep(500);&#xA;    motor[LEFT] = 0;&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;///////////////////////////////&#xA;&#xA;void TurnBySteer(int d)&#xA;{&#xA;    // normalize -100 100 to 0 200&#xA;    nSyncedTurnRatio = d + 100; &#xA;}&#xA;///////////////////////////////&#xA;&#xA;typedef enum programPhase { starting, searching, following, finished };&#xA;programPhase phase = starting;&#xA;&#xA;// these 'tasks' are called from a loop, thus do not need to loop themselves&#xA;&#xA;void initialize()&#xA;{&#xA;    nSyncedTurnRatio = 50;&#xA;    nSyncedMotors = synchBC;&#xA;    motor[LEFT] = 30;       // start a spiral drive&#xA;    phase = searching;&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;void search()&#xA;{&#xA;    if (light_value &amp;lt; 24)&#xA;    {&#xA;        nSyncedTurnRatio = 100;&#xA;        phase = following;&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;int lastLight = -1;&#xA;int currentSteer = 0;&#xA;void follow()&#xA;{&#xA;    // if it is solid white we have lost the line and must stop&#xA;    // if lightSensors detects dark, we are on line&#xA;    // if it got lighter, we are going more off line&#xA;    // if it got darker we are headed in a good direction, slow down turn in anticipation&#xA;    // +++PID will be even smoother&#xA;    if (light_value &amp;gt; 64)&#xA;    {&#xA;        motor[LEFT] = 0;&#xA;        phase = finished;&#xA;        return;&#xA;    }&#xA;    if (light_value &amp;lt; 24)&#xA;        currentSteer = 0;&#xA;    else if (light_value &amp;gt; lastLight)&#xA;        currentSteer += sgn(currentSteer) * 1;&#xA;    else    // implied (light_value &amp;lt; lastLight)&#xA;        currentSteer -= sgn(currentSteer) * 1;      &#xA;&#xA;    TurnBySteer(currentSteer);&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;bool regularProcessing_wantsToRun()&#xA;{&#xA;    return phase != finished;&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;void regularProcessing_task()&#xA;{&#xA;    switch (phase)&#xA;    {&#xA;    case starting:&#xA;        initialize();&#xA;        break;&#xA;    case searching:&#xA;        search();&#xA;        break;&#xA;    case following:&#xA;        follow();&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;task main()&#xA;{&#xA;    // subsumption tasks in priority oder&#xA;    while (true)&#xA;    {&#xA;        // read sensors once per loop&#xA;        distance_value = SensorValue[S_DISTANCE];&#xA;        light_value = SensorValue[S_LIGHT];&#xA;        if (evade_wantsToRun())&#xA;            evade_task();&#xA;        if (regularProcessing_wantsToRun())&#xA;            regularProcessing_task();&#xA;        else&#xA;            StopAllTasks();&#xA;        EndTimeSlice();     // give others a chance, but make it as short as possible&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="274" LastEditorUserId="94" LastEditDate="2012-11-12T03:25:10.157" LastActivityDate="2012-11-12T03:25:10.157" CommentCount="4" />

Generally you would just give the robotic arm an end point or perhaps a series of way points you expect the end effector to follow. You can then use the forward kinematics to move the end effector between those waypoints. In order to avoid your difficult to describe constraint you can define a value function that increases as the arm moves and reduces the slack on the wire. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you guess a path most likely your initial guess will result in the wire being snapped. You're value function will give you a score representing this fact. You can then take your in between waypoints and tweak them a bit which may result in the function represetnging your constraint to decrease.

Specifically unsupervised learning methods receive no information what-so-ever regarding what is correct during training.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Common formulations of the reward function provide the agent with a positive or zero reward as long as it performs within the acceptable bounds and a negative reward if it performs incorrect or sub-optimal actions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Frequently an RL agent cannot directly determine the reward function and instead it develops a policy that defines which action to take given a particular state of the world.

Since there is no guarantee that the current policy is optimal it is necessary for the agent to occasionally select actions other than what is prescribed by the policy.

The robot has a basic tank drive, so the encoders sufficiently supply ticks from the left and right wheels. The IMU gives roll, pitch, yaw, and linear accelerations in x, y, and z. We could later add other IMUs, which would give redundancy, but could also additionally provide angular rates of roll, pitch, and yaw. The GPS publishes global x, y, and z coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Knowing the robot's x y position and heading will useful for the robot to localize and map out it's environment to navigate. The robot's velocity could also be useful for making smooth movement decisions. It's a ground-based robot, so we don't care too much about the z axis. The robot also has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIDAR&quot;&gt;lidar&lt;/a&gt; sensor and a camera--so roll and pitch will be useful for transforming the lidar and camera data for better orientation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm trying to figure out how to fuse all these numbers together in a way that optimally takes advantage of all sensors' accuracy. Right now we're using a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter&quot;&gt;Kalman filter&lt;/a&gt; to generate an estimate of &lt;code&gt;[x, x-vel, x-accel, y, y-vel, y-accel]&lt;/code&gt; with the simple transition matrix:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[[1, dt, .5*dt*dt, 0,  0,        0],&#xA; [0,  1,       dt, 0,  0,        0],&#xA; [0,  0,        1, 0,  0,        0],&#xA; [0,  0,        0, 1, dt, .5*dt*dt],&#xA; [0,  0,        0, 0,  1,       dt],&#xA; [0,  0,        0, 0,  0,        1]]&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The filter estimates state exclusively based on the accelerations provided by the IMU. (The IMU isn't the best quality; within about 30 seconds it will show the robot (at rest) drifting a good 20 meters from its initial location.) I want to know out how to use roll, pitch, and yaw from the IMU, and potentially roll, pitch, and yaw rates, encoder data from the wheels, and GPS data to improve the state estimate. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using a bit of math, we can use the two encoders to generate x, y, and heading information on the robot, as well as linear and angular velocities. The encoders are very accurate, but they can be susceptible to slippage on an outdoor field. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that there are two separate sets of data here, which are difficult to fuse:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Estimates of x, x-vel, x-accel, y, y-vel, y-accel&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Estimates of roll, pitch, yaw, and rates of roll, pitch, and yaw&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even though there's crossover between these two sets, I'm having trouble reasoning about how to put them together. For example, if the robot is going  at a constant speed, the direction of robot, determined by its x-vel and y-vel, will be the same as its yaw. Although, if the robot is at rest, the yaw cannot be accurately determined by the x and y velocities. Also, data provided by the encoders, translated to angular velocity, could  be an update to the yaw rate... but how could an update to the yaw rate end up providing better positional estimates?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does it make sense to put all 12 numbers into the same filter, or are they normally kept separate?

The transition from&#xA;$x(t)=[x,y,\dot{x},\dot{y},\theta,\dot{\theta}]$ to $x(t+1)$ is not a linear function due to the&#xA;angular accelerations and velocities.

See: Robot Operating System &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ros.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ROS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, to explain the EKF in the context of your system.&#xA;We have an IMU+Gyro, GPS, and&#xA;odometry. The robot in question is a differential drive as mentioned.&#xA;The filtering task is to take the current pose estimate of the robot&#xA;${\hat{x}_t}$, the control inputs $u_t$, and the measurements from&#xA;each sensor, $z_t$, and produce the estimate at the next time step&#xA;$\hat{x}_{t+1}$. We'll call the IMU measurements $I_t$, GPS is $G_t$, and&#xA;odometry, $O_t$. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I assume we are interested in estimating the robot pose as&#xA;$x_t={x,y,\dot{x},\dot{y},\theta,\dot{\theta}}$.&#xA;The problem with IMU and Gyros is drift. There is a non-stationary&#xA;bias in the accelerations which you must account for in the EKF. This&#xA;is done (usually) by putting the bias into the estimated state. This&#xA;allows you to directly estimate the bias at each time step.&#xA;$x_t={x,y,\dot{x},\dot{y},\theta,\dot{\theta},b}$, for a vector of&#xA;biases $b$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm assuming:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;$O_t$ = two distance measurements representing the distance the&#xA;treads have travelled in some small time increment&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;$I_t$ = three orientation measurements ${\alpha, \beta, \theta}$ and three accelleration&#xA;measurements ${\ddot{x},\ddot{y},\ddot{z}}$. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;$G_t$ = the position of the robot in the &lt;em&gt;global&lt;/em&gt; frame,&#xA;$^Gx_t,^Gy_t$.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Typically, the result of the control inputs (desired speeds for each&#xA;tread) are difficult to map to the outputs (the change in the pose of&#xA;the robot).  In place of $u$, it is common (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.probabilistic-robotics.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Thrun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/106/what-is-a-suitable-model-for-two-wheeled-robots/134#134&quot;&gt;Odometry Question&lt;/a&gt;) to use the&#xA;odometry as the &quot;result&quot; of the control. This assumption works well&#xA;when you are not on a near-frictionless surface. The IMU and GPS can&#xA;help correct for slippage, as we'll see.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the first task is to predict the next state from the current state:&#xA;$\hat{x}_{t+1} = f(\hat{x}_t,u_t)$. In the case of a differential&#xA;drive robot, this prediction can be obtained directly from literature&#xA;(see &lt;a href=&quot;http://ijr.sagepub.com/content/8/5/15.short&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;On the Kinematics of Wheeled Mobile Robots&lt;/a&gt; or the more concise treatment in any modern robotics textbook), or derived from scratch as shown here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/106/what-is-a-suitable-model-for-two-wheeled-robots/134#134&quot;&gt;Odometry Question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, we can now predict $\hat{x}_{t+1} = f(\hat{x}_t, O_t)$. This is&#xA;the propagation or prediction step. You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; operate a robot by simply&#xA;propagating. If the values $O_t$ are completely accurate, you will&#xA;never have an estimate $\hat{x}$ which does not exactly equal your&#xA;true state. This never happens in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This only gives a predicted value from the previous estimate,&#xA;and does not tell us how the accuracy of the estimate degrades with&#xA;time. So, to propagate the uncertainty, you must use the EKF equations&#xA;(which propagate the uncertainty in closed form under Gaussian noise&#xA;assumptions), a particle filter (which uses a sampling-based&#xA;approach)*, the UKF (which uses a point-wise approximation of the&#xA;uncertainty), or one of many other variants.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the case of the EKF, we proceed as follows. Let $P_t$ be the&#xA;covariance matrix of the robot state. We linearize the function $f$&#xA;using Taylor-series expansion to obtain a linear system. A linear&#xA;system can be easily solved using the Kalman Filter. Assume the&#xA;covariance of the estimate at time $t$ is $P_t$, and the assumed&#xA;covariance of the noise in the odometry is given as the matrix $U_t$&#xA;(usually a diagonal $2\times2$ matrix, like $.1\times I_{2\times 2}$).&#xA;In the case of the function $f$, we obtain the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jacobian&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;$F_x=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ and $F_u=\frac{\partial f}{\partial&#xA;u}$, then propagate the uncertainty as,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$P_{t+1}=F_x*P_t*F_x^T + F_u*U_t*F_u^T$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now we can propagate the estimate and the uncertainty. Note the&#xA;uncertainty will monotonically increase with time. This is expected.&#xA;To fix this, what is typically done, is to use the $I_t$ and $G_t$ to&#xA;update the predicted state. This is called the measurement step of the&#xA;filtering process, as the sensors provide an indirect measurement of&#xA;the state of the robot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, use each sensor to estimate some part of the robot state&#xA;as some function $h_g()$ and $h_i()$ for GPS, IMU. Form&#xA;the &lt;em&gt;residual&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;innovation&lt;/em&gt; which is the difference of the&#xA;predicted and measured values. &#xA;Then, estimate the accuracy for each sensor estimate in&#xA;the form of a covariance matrix $R$ for all sensors ($R_g$, $R_i$ in&#xA;this case). Finally, find the Jacobians of $h$ and update the state&#xA;estimate as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For each sensor $s$ with state estimate $z_s$  (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Kalman_filter#Update&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Following wikipedia's entry&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$v_s=z_s- h_s(\hat{x}_{t+1})$$&#xA;$$S_s = H_s*P_{t+1}*H_s^T + R_s$$&#xA;$$K = P_{t+1}*H_s^T S^{-1}_s$$&#xA;$$\hat{x}_{t+1} = \hat{x}_{t+1} - K*v$$&#xA;$$P_{t+1} = (I-K*H_s)*P_{t+1}$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the case of GPS, the measurement $z_g=h_g()$ it is probably just a&#xA;transformation from latitude and longitude to the local frame of the&#xA;robot, so the Jacobian $H_g$ will be nearly Identity. $R_g$ is&#xA;reported directly by the GPS unit in most cases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the case of the IMU+Gyro, the function $z_i=h_i()$ is an integration of&#xA;accelerations, and an additive bias term. One way to handle the IMU is&#xA;to numerically integrate the accelerations to find a position and&#xA;velocity estimate at the desired time.  If your IMU has a small&#xA;additive noise term $p_i$ for each acceleration estimate, then you&#xA;must integrate this noise to find the accuracy of the position&#xA;estimate.  Then the covariance $R_i$ is the integration of all the&#xA;small additive noise terms, $p_i$. Incorporating the update for the&#xA;bias is more difficult, and out of my expertise. However, since you are interested in planar motion, you can probably simplify the problem. &#xA;You'll have to look in literature for this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some off-the-top-of-my-head references: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ee.ucr.edu/~mourikis/papers/Li2012-ICRA.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Improving the Accuracy of EKF-Based Visual-Inertial&#xA;Odometry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~stergios/papers/AR-CL-Consistency-2010.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Observability-based Consistent EKF Estimators for Multi-robot&#xA;Cooperative&#xA;Localization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://s-space.snu.ac.kr/handle/10371/10151&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Adaptive two-stage EKF for INS-GPS loosely coupled system with&#xA;unknown fault bias&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This field is mature enough that google (scholar) could probably find&#xA;you a working implementation.

However, this will be very noisy, especially when the hand is moving from one pose to another. This is because the direction of acceleration is directly used to estimate the direction of gravity. Thus, &lt;strong&gt;this option would only be useful if the hand is not moving&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Gyroscopes allow the direction of gravity to be stabilized. &lt;strong&gt;This allows the data to remain useful during movement.&lt;/strong&gt; Drift/bias is not a problem, so long as you correct for this. This can be done by using a Kalman filter, with a model of gyroscopic drift. The drift is corrected by comparing the derivative of the long term estimate of the direction of gravity compared to the gyroscopic data. Some IMUs correct for drift automatically, for example, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vectornav.com/products/vn100-rug&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;VN-100 from VectorNav&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Magnetometers provides a global estimate of the remaining angular direction (yaw). This simply &lt;strong&gt;adds further useful data&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you only place the IMUs on the fingertips, the data is insufficient to estimate pose. Remember that IMUs only measure &lt;strong&gt;attitude&lt;/strong&gt; (also known as orientation) in space. Can you imagine cases where the fingertip may remain in the same orientation, yet the hand pose is different?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/cUbSv.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hand pose&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Observe that the index fingertip orientation does not change, however, the position (pose) has changed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, you can see that IMU data on the fingertips is not enough to estimate pose. However, additional data can improve the estimate of hand pose, if you fuse the IMU data with your existing data using a Kalman filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is theoretically &lt;strong&gt;possible&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;IMU data alone&lt;/strong&gt; to be sufficient to estimate pose. However, this would require an IMU for each and every &lt;strong&gt;independently movable&lt;/strong&gt; part of the hand. Since I cannot independently move the top two segments of each finger, we would only need 2 IMUs per finger (one on the fingertip, and one on the segment just after the knuckle, ie. segments 1 and 3 on the finger), plus 2 for the hand, and another for the end of the arm (to get the wrist motion). Therefore, you need a total of &lt;strong&gt;13 IMUs&lt;/strong&gt; to get all the data required.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not know that much about the price of tiny IMUs, however, I would guess that it is not that cheap to get that many IMUs (I don't know your budget). Normally, a single IMU is used for a rigid body. IMUs vary in price (a list at &lt;a href=&quot;http://damien.douxchamps.net/research/imu/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://damien.douxchamps.net/research/imu/&lt;/a&gt;), but say, the VN-100 IMU might be able to give you 0.1 degree accuracy in optimal conditions. If you get a cheaper IMU, the accuracy may not be as good and/or they may lack an integrated Kalman Filter. Getting 13 VN-100 IMUs, costing thousands would probably break the bank (although the VN-100 at 20x20x2mm may not be appropriate if you want an IMU with a smaller form factor).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My suggestion is to consider other data sources which may be obtained more cheaply. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;camera-based systems&lt;/strong&gt;, after image processing, you can get data about the position of different parts of the hand. Image processing can be aided by using some sort of reflective markers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;sensors embedded in the fabric of the glove&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;strain gauges&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;SMA wire&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="145" LastEditorUserId="145" LastEditDate="2012-11-14T10:18:24.913" LastActivityDate="2012-11-14T10:18:24.913" CommentCount="3" />

Like any other machine learning technique or algorithm, it can be used to determine a function which you don't know - given that you choose a good reward function that is related to the problem you want to solve. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, in a nutshell: you can use Reinforcement Learning to determine the inverse kinematics of a robot (if there is no analytical solution or determining one would be ridiculously hard). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="422" LastActivityDate="2012-11-14T17:40:44.207" />

The same sources of stress and wear apply: the load tension, bending around pulleys, friction with other objects and friction between its own strands.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fatigue is much of what limits the life of a cable/wire rope, and both bending stress and abrasion play a role. Each time a section of the cable passes through a pulley or is wound around a drum, it must bend and straighten again. This creates a repeated reversing stress that causes cracks to grow through the material until it breaks (fatigue). Abrasion has a synergistic effect, by roughening the outside of the wires and making it easier for cracks to form. Both the abrasion and bending stresses are greatest at the outside of the cable, so those strands tend to fail first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It might not even be the cable itself that breaks. Consider an everyday cable actuated mechanism: the window regulator that raises and lowers side windows in an automobile. It's not usually the cable or motor that fails, but rather the pulleys break. The pulleys are usually plastic and only supported on one side, so they're not as strong as the steel cable they're supporting. Sometimes the manufacturers don't even use pulleys, and instead just use a U-shaped plastic channel. Then, the cable slowly saws through the plastic piece. I suppose it only has to outlast the warranty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some guidelines for maximum life are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Keep the diameters of pulleys and winding drums large relative to the cable. 10 times the diameter of the cable is barely enough, and 40 times the diameter of the cable is not too much.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lubricating the cable helps extend life both by reducing abrasion and by letting the strands slide against each other, making the cable more flexible and reducing bending stress.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Don't neglect the other parts of the system, such as the pulleys the cable wraps around, guides it runs through, and its attachment points. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Don't neglect the environment.

This rules out the SLAM component, since visual odometry is only a relative means of navigation (see my answer on &lt;a href=&quot;http://robotics.stackexchange.com/a/207/127&quot;&gt;navigation&lt;/a&gt;). There are a number of methods to extract the relative motion of the camera. Since the transform from camera to robot is known this will also give you the relative transform of your robot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you only work with a single camera, you will always have a scale ambiguity, unless you have something to resolve that ambiguity in your image (e.g. object of known size) or combine it with another form of odometry like wheel odometry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a vision point of you, there are two ways you can follow: dense and sparse processing. Dense processing means, you use a regular sampling of your image points for your processing (could also be the full image). Sparse processing would mean, that you first extract feature points and only perform your operations on these features. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using optical flow for visual odometry, I would consider a dense approach. Once you got the flow field, you need to extract the motion components. This is not so trivial, as it largely depends on how your environment looks. There was an interesting way of resolving this in the presence of outliers presented in &quot;Monocular Heading Estimation in Non-Stationary Urban Environment&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sparse approaches will use features, which are extracted using feature detectors. Then there are two different methods on handling the features. First approach will perform tracking of the feature and in this way estimate where the scene point was moving to. Second approach performs association of features through feature descriptors. First one is usually used with fast algorithms on high frequency, while the second one is more robust to larger scene changes and hence can be run at lower frequency. The visual odometry on the MER Rovers works this way e.g. Some form of geometric constraint is used to remove outliers, usually with a form of RANSAC.

Whether the disturbance is enough depends on how large the motors are.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, because I mounted an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) with magnetometers near some motors, and was forced to turn off the magnetometers to avoid the measurement affecting the state estimation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In practice, the solutions most likely to solve your problem is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;move the compass/magnetometer away from from the motors&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;use shielding material (basically material with high magnetic permeability). They do not block magnetic fields, but because they provide a path of low magnetic resistance, they attact the magnetic field (lines from north to south) to pass through their interior, so that the magnetic field intensity is lower elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The best shape for magnetic shields is thus a closed container surrounding the shielded volume. The effectiveness of this type of shielding depends on the material's permeability, which generally drops off at both very low magnetic field strengths and at high field strengths where the material becomes saturated. So to achieve low residual fields, magnetic shields often consist of several enclosures one inside the other, each of which successively reduces the field inside it. - &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_shielding#Magnetic_shielding&quot;&gt;Wikipedia/Magnetic shielding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can thus wrap the motors in shielding material, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Giron&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;MagnetShield&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;PaperShield&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Magnetic Shielding Foil&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mag-Stop Plates&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;MetGlas&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;JointShield&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Finemet (for kHz frequency fields)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;CobalTex&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A good site for comparison of these materials is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lessemf.com/mag-shld.html&quot;&gt;LessEMF.com Magnetic Field Shielding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is theoretically possible to correct for the magnetic disturbance without shielding. We do need to be aware that there are two possible sources - a rotating permanent magnet and/or current in the coils. If we have feedback of the rotor position, we can correct for the permanent magnet or coil position. If you perform some experiments, recording current and rotor position, you should be able to fit a model of the magnetic field. Fitting is necessary because the actual field strength is very hard to calculate because of how the magnetic field looks depends on the size and shape of both the magnet and coils.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In practice, it is difficult to do this - unless the motor is turning very slowly and your sensor and model is accurate enough. First, if the frequency is high, it can cause problems because of synchronization issues and communication delays. If you cannot synchronize the data obtained from the motor feedback (position and current) and that from your magnetometers, you will increase your uncertainty.

This is frequently done with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_space&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;state-space&lt;/a&gt; formulation of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equations_of_motion&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;equations of motion&lt;/a&gt;.

Yes, in order to model them with PWM input then you need to determine the transfer function from the PWM values you supply to the output of your actuators. Then you plug that function in for the control signal in your model. Again the derivation of this function is robot specific. The current battery voltage and the mass of the robot would likely be useful but I don't know about the velocity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second question is, given a mathematical model of my robot, what is the best way to train a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to control it? In short there is no one best way. Training directly on the robot tends to be time consuming because it takes the robot longer to execute trials. Simulations however can result in policies that are less accurate because the physics of the simulation are necesssarily simplified. Another approach is to train the learner in simulation to get a reasonable approximation and then transfer the resulting policy to the robot for further refinement. This of course fails if the model is not sufficiently accurate. It also requires extra development.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally you ask &quot;Can I [remodel and retrain the robot] by providing some random stimulus PWMs and measuring the response?&quot; In the case of RL there is no reason to think the new optimal policy is anything like the previous optimal policy and as such there isn't much reason to think a few random controls will supply sufficient information to change the policy appropriately. Of course retraining only needs to occur if the changes you make to your robot affect the formulation of the state-space model and/or the action model that you use. For instance, if your action model is in terms of high level actions (&quot;go-left&quot;, &quot;go-right&quot;, &quot;go-forward&quot;) then changing the dynamics requires changing how you implement these motions but the policy should still hold.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="177" LastActivityDate="2012-11-16T00:42:20.687" />

We can see why your approach suffers from it with a fairly simple example. Let's say you have 3 particles and their normalized weights are 0.1, 0.1, 0.8. Then multiplying by each weight by the 3 yields 0.3, 0.3, and 2.4. Then rounding yields 0, 0, 2. This means you would not pick the first two particles and the last one would be picked twice. Now you are down to two particles. I suspect this is what you have been seeing when you say &quot;due to the roundoff errors, I end up having less particles.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An alternative selection method would be as follows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Normalize weights.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Calculate an array of the cumulative sum of the weights.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Randomly generate a number &amp;amp; determine which range in that cumulative weight array to which the number belongs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The index of that range would correspond to the particle that should be created.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Repeat until you have the desired number of samples.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, using the example above we would start with the normalized weights. We would then calculate the array [0.1, 0.2, 1]. From there we calculate 3 random numbers say 0.15, 0.38, and 0.54. This would have us pick the second particle once and the third particle twice. The point is that it gives the smaller particles a chance to propagate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing to note is that while this method will deal with impoverishment it can lead to a suboptimal solutions. For instance, it may be that none of the particles really match your given location well (assuming you're using this for localization). The weights only tell you which particles match best, not the quality of the match. As such when you take additional readings and repeat the process you may find that all your particles group at a single location that is not the correct location. This is usually because there were no good particles to start. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="177" LastEditorUserId="350" LastEditDate="2012-11-25T21:19:02.897" LastActivityDate="2012-11-25T21:19:02.897" CommentCount="2" />

The principle is that the weight represents the relative probability with respect to the other particles. In the resampling step, you draw from the set of particles such that for each particle, the normalized weight times the number of particles represents the number of times that particle is drawn on average. In that your idea is correct. Only by using rounding instead of sampling, you will always eliminate particles for which the expected value is less than half. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways to perform the resampling properly. There is a nice paper called &lt;a href=&quot;http://users.isy.liu.se/rt/schon/Publications/HolSG2006.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;On resampling algorithms for particle filters&lt;/a&gt;, comparing the different methods. Just to give a quick overview:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multinomial resampling: imagine a strip of paper where each particle has a section, where the length is proportional to its weight. Randomly pick a location on the strip N times, and pick the particle associated with the section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residual resampling: this approach tries to reduce the variance of the sampling, by first allocating each particle their integer floor of the expected value, and leave the rest to multinomial resampling. E.g. a particle with an expected value of 2.5 will have 2 copies in the resampled set and another one with an expected value of 0.5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systematic resampling: take a ruler with regular spaced marks, such that N marks are the same length as your strip of paper. Randomly place the ruler next to your strip. Take the particles at the marks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stratified resampling: same as systematic resampling, except that the marks on the ruler are not evenly placed, but added as N random processes sampling from the interval 0..1/N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So to answer your question: what you have implemented could be extended to a form of residual sampling.

Most ICs work well on 5V, and an Arduino needs 9V, so that's what I end up using (Note: the 5V/3V output pins on the Arduino are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; really meant to be used much. They don't supply much power, so it's best to have a separate 5V line for your circuitry).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After this, I connect all components in parallel to their respective power pins. It is generally beneficial to power the motor with a separate source (common ground). The motor draws the most current, so the simple act of stopping/slowing a motor can send fluctuations throughout the circuit. If you don't want to do this, at least add &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seattlerobotics.org/encoder/jun97/basics.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;bypass capacitors&lt;/a&gt; to the motor and the power inputs(Vcc/Gnd) of logic circuits (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/267/why-are-capacitors-added-to-motors-in-parallel-what-is-their-purpose&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more on how they work).

That being said, some  AI-related things like image processing can be found prepackaged for use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding kits, I don't know of there's any such kit that's better than the NXT. For &quot;serious robotics&quot;, such kits will always prove inadequate as they're restrictive in many ways. What I suggest is to start using an Arduino or Raspberry Pi. A Raspberry Pi fits your criteria more--it has a good amount of RAM, and runs Linux--so it's easier to work with (it's pretty much like programming a normal application, except you don't need to create a GUI for the app). It's extremely cheap, costs $25-$35. You can use whatever language you want here, as long as you have something to make the language run on Linux (gcc/python/java--generally these are all built in, though you can easily find APT packages for stuff like ruby). In addition, it's easy to find packages for tasks like image processing/etc. It also has 512MB of RAM, which is good enough unless you want to play Warcraft on it. You do have to get familiar with Linux to use this, though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Arduino's another good (possibly better) option. You can program it in C/C++/Java (and some other languages if you use some third party tools). It is low on RAM, though--you sometimes need to chain two Arduinos in a master-slave configuration to get stuff done. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only issue is, you need to make your own sensors for the Raspberry Pi (sensors for the Arduino exist and some can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trossenrobotics.com/c/arduino-sensors.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, there is some examples using NXT equipment &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dexterindustries.com/blog/2013/02/27/connecting-the-arduino-and-the-lego-mindstorms-howto/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) Generally not that hard (for example, a light/dark sensor can be made with a photodiode and resistor), though this is a big shift from the NXT (which was plug-and-play). You'll have to get your own servos and learn how they are controlled, and lots of other little things. You &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; have to get your hands dirty with soldering control boards/etc, and you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; have to know a decent amount of electronics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise you can just continue using the NXT, there are all sorts of premade sensors out there (though custom making your own sensor isn't that easy). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="126" LastEditorUserId="998" LastEditDate="2013-03-09T11:39:43.197" LastActivityDate="2013-03-09T11:39:43.197" CommentCount="9" />

Then you can obtain the Jacobian by &lt;em&gt;differentiating the forward kinematics&lt;/em&gt; with respect to the joint variables:&#xA;$$&#xA;J = \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} = &#xA;\begin{bmatrix}&#xA;  \frac{\partial f_{\text{pos}}}{\partial \theta_1}, &amp;amp; \frac{\partial f_{\text{pos}}}{\partial \theta_2} &amp;amp; ..., \frac{\partial f_{\text{pos}}}{\partial \theta_n} \\&#xA;  \frac{\partial f_{\text{rot}}}{\partial \theta_1}, &amp;amp; \frac{\partial f_{\text{rot}}}{\partial \theta_2} &amp;amp; ..., \frac{\partial f_{\text{rot}}}{\partial \theta_n}&#xA;\end{bmatrix}&#xA;$$ &#xA;is your manipulator's Jacobian. Inverting it would give you the inverse kinematics with respcet to &lt;em&gt;velocities&lt;/em&gt;. It can still be useful though, if you want to know how far each joint has to move if you want to move your end effector by some &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; amount $\Delta x$ in any direction (because on position level, this would effectively be a linearization):&#xA;$$&#xA; \Delta \theta = J^{-1}\Delta x&#xA;$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope that this helps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="422" LastActivityDate="2012-11-26T10:54:22.753" CommentCount="6" />

With traditional single rotor helicopters, control is a function of the orientation of the rotor which means you must change its orientation to change direction of the craft. This makes for very complex mechanical linkages comparatively speaking and it complicates the dynamics. With tri-copters the dynamics include an imbalance of the moments induced by the spinning of the rotors. With more than four rotors you get improved stability and some ability to handle failure, such as a motor going out, but you quickly run into a power problem. The more motors you need to drive the higher your power requirements and quadrotors are already very power hungry. This is a major issue in robotics in general.

It is likely that the inverse kinematics applied already repeatedly linearises the problem and performs some type of gradient descent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To alter a solution, you can find the null-space of the linearised system of equations, and use that vector to modify your solution towards the joint limits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To do this, you simply differentiate your system of equations to obtain a linearisation, so for example, you get:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$\Delta \alpha \vec{a}+\Delta \beta\vec{b}+\Delta \gamma\vec{c}+\Delta \delta\vec{d}=&#xA;\left[\begin{matrix}\vec{a}&amp;amp;\vec{b}&amp;amp;\vec{c}&amp;amp;\vec{d}\end{matrix}\right]&#xA;\left[\begin{matrix}\Delta \alpha \\\Delta \beta\\\Delta \gamma\\\Delta \delta\end{matrix}\right]&#xA;=&#xA;\left[\begin{matrix}\Delta x\\\Delta y\\\Delta z\end{matrix}\right]$, where $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\delta$ are the angles of the revolute joints, with appropriate coefficients.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finding the null-space means finding the $\Delta \alpha$, $\Delta \beta$, $\Delta \gamma$, $\Delta \delta$ such that $\Delta x, \Delta y, \Delta z = 0$. You can do this easily (choose from gaussian elimination, matrix divide etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you modify the angles by a small multiple of the null-space vector over many iterations, you should eventually get within the joint constraints (if it is possible). You just need to decide on the direction (check each angle, and if it is not within range, it should provide the appropriate angle).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your inverse kinematics algorithm/code takes initial joint angles to start it off, you can put the new joint angles back in here so that the x, y and z positions don't drift away from the desired positions. This also allows you to take larger steps with the null-space vector (which otherwise tends to make the position tracked start to become less inaccurate).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, the null-space may contain more than one vector. This would occur if you only wanted to fix two of the degrees of freedom. In this case, in each iteration, you can modify using only one or both of the vectors. Similar logic can be applied to get the angles within the constraints - just decide on the direction in which to apply each vector by checking if each revolute joint angle is within the constraints, and if not, it will give you a direction to apply the vector.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="145" LastActivityDate="2012-11-30T10:39:48.760" />

Once you dial it perfectly for one set of conditions, the environment or wear conditions will change and you'll have to tune it up again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Surface conditions, traction, attitude, motor-isolation (the distribution of electrical power to each motor from a common power source), and many other real-time operational factors effect forward velocity for each side of the 'bot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Depending on your precision requirements, something as simple as a magnetic compass (position as far forward on the robot as possible to maximize its responsiveness) could help you maintain a heading during forward motion. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Often it isn't critically important precisely which direction your 'bot is moving; rather, it simply needs to be making progress on some task (follow the leader, search for a target, etc). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you post greater detail on your robot and its design objectives, I could assist you further.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;A note about magnetic sensor placement&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, why should I &quot;position [the magnetic transducer] as far forward as possble&quot;? Isn't it true that the angle is the same? Yup. That's true, but the magnitude of the Earth's magnetic field is not. &lt;em&gt;You are standing in a different spot on Earth&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Imagine your robot is as big as a car. If you sit in the geometric center of the car and the car pivots about you, your coordinates on the Earth have not changed; only your attitude has. Now if you are sitting on the hood of the car and the car repeats it's previous motion, &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; your attitude and your coordinates have changed. Changing coordinates produces a bigger difference in magnitude of the Earth's field than rotation alone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years I worked on a team with Dr. Dwight Veihland of Virginia Tech, arguably the world's leading expert on super-high sensitivity magnetic sensors.

It may also mean the torque load that causes the output rotational speed of a device to become zero - i.e. to cause &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stall_%28engine%29&quot;&gt;stalling&lt;/a&gt;. Stalling is a condition when the motor stops rotating. This condition occurs when the load torque is greater than the motor shaft torque i.e. break down torque condition. In this condition the motor draws maximum current but the motor do not rotate.The current is called as Stalling current.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;h3&gt;Electric motors&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor&quot;&gt;Electric motors&lt;/a&gt; continue to provide torque when stalled. However, electric motors left in a stalled condition are prone to overheating and possible damage since the current flowing is maximum under these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The maximum torque an electric motor can produce in the long term when stalled without causing damage is called the &lt;strong&gt;maximum continuous stall torque&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vexrobotics.com/276-2181.html&quot;&gt;specification&lt;/a&gt; of this motor&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Stall Torque:  8.6 in-lbs&#xA;Stall Current: 2.6 A&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;we can see that if the motor is required to apply more than 8.6 in-lbs of torque the motor will stop moving (or accelerating if working against friction) and will be drawing the maximum 2.6A of current.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although it doesn't say what kind of motor it is, I would expect it to be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushed_DC_electric_motor&quot;&gt;Brushed DC electric motor&lt;/a&gt; given it's two wire interface.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;As an unloaded DC motor spins, it generates a backwards-flowing electromotive force that resists the current being applied to the motor. The current through the motor drops as the rotational speed increases, and a free-spinning motor has very little current. It is only when a load is applied to the motor that slows the rotor that the current draw through the motor increases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-electromotive_force&quot;&gt;Counter electromotive force&lt;/a&gt; wikipedia page:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;motor control&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;robotics&lt;/strong&gt;, the term &quot;Back-EMF&quot; often refers to using the voltage generated by a spinning motor to infer the speed of the motor's rotation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note however, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://robotics.stackexchange.com/a/644/37&quot;&gt;DrFriedParts explains&lt;/a&gt;, this is only part of the story. The &lt;strong&gt;maximum &lt;em&gt;continuous&lt;/em&gt; stall torque&lt;/strong&gt; may be much lower than the &lt;strong&gt;maximum torque&lt;/strong&gt; and thus current. For instance if you switch from full torque in one direction to full torque in the other. In this case, the current drawn could be double the &lt;em&gt;continuous&lt;/em&gt; stall current. Do this often enough, exceeding the duty cycle of the motor and you could burn out your motor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Free Current&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, looking at the specification:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Free Speed:     100 rpm&#xA;Free Current:   0.18 A&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So when running freely, without load, it will rapidly accelerate up to 100 rpm, where it will draw just 180 mA to maintain that speed given friction and back-emf.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again however, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://robotics.stackexchange.com/a/644/37&quot;&gt;DrFriedParts explains&lt;/a&gt;, this is also only part of the story.

Coverage, because we must cover each point on the floor, and online because we do not have offline access to the map. If you are interested in the most recent results, I suggest you lookup &quot;&lt;strong&gt;robotic online coverage algorithms&lt;/strong&gt;,&quot; perhaps in google scholar (there are &lt;em&gt;lots and lots&lt;/em&gt; of great results).

You can run all-pairs shortest paths, but what are the points? You don't have a map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online algorithms like this are often called &quot;bug&quot; algorithms because they tend to look like a bug wandering across an area, bumping into something, then wandering around it a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With no obstacles, and a rectangular room, and assuming you start on the &lt;em&gt;boundary&lt;/em&gt; a boustrophedon (way of the ox) path is optimal. &#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/XYE6t.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Funny that farmers have been doing this forever, right? &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boustrophedon&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boustrophedon&lt;/a&gt;.

Well, imagine you drop into the world, and can't see the perimeter. You can walk in a straight line until you reach the perimeter, then do a boustrophedon, right? Except now you &quot;wasted&quot; the time spent finding the perimeter, because you will cover that part twice.  This is why robots tend to spiral: By the time you reach a boundary, you have covered a lot of the area ($\pi*d^2$ where $d$ is the distance to the &lt;em&gt;nearest&lt;/em&gt; boundary, right?). This is helpful: now you are guaranteed to find the nearest boundary, and can trace it out.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is a huge, fascinating area. I'm sorry I can't provide a better summary! &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem is you don't have a map.

Especially when you system is moving, having something flying around that is conductive can screw you in the literal sense. insulation tape, tubing whatever are the weapons of choice here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connectors: Try never to use connectors that could be plugged the wrong way, or use the same connectors for different ports. Always check your connector thrice on the running system with a voltmeter before connecting it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diodes can be useful to prevent overvoltage or reverse polarity, they are however useless if your power source is very powerfull, burns your diode, and gets through anyway.

I'll add one extra point for completeness...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There seems to be trend among less experienced designers to assume that stall current and free current equate to the maximum and minimum currents the motor might encounter. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They don't.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They are the &lt;em&gt;effective nominal&lt;/em&gt; values. You can exceed these limits under relatively common circumstances if you are not careful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Exceeding the minimum&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As @Ian and @Mark have noted. The motor can turn into a generator (google &quot;regenerative braking&quot;) when an outside source or event causes the motor to move faster than its applied current/voltage. For example, Ian's going down a hill or someone hand cranking the motor. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The current in these situations can not only be less than the free current, but actually go negative (go in the opposite direction -- acts like a source rather than a load).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you think of it from a work (energy) perspective, say you are pushing a box of clothes down a hallway. It doesn't take much effort to do that, but if your buddy starts pushing with you, however little effort you were expending is lessened. That is the case of a motor going down a slight grade.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Exceeding the maximum&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A secondary consequence of the generation function of the motor is that once it acquires momentum, it continues to convert that energy into electro-motive force (voltage) once power is no longer applied. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The interesting case is when you are reversing directions. If you rev the motor forward, then immediately switch directions, the voltage on the motor coil is momentarily about &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt; the previous supply voltage since the motor back-EMF is now in series with the supply. This results, as expected from Ohm's law, in current in excess of stall current.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Practical solution&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, practical bi-directional motor control circuits include &quot;free-wheeling&quot; diodes (D1-D4) in the figure to provide a return path for the back-emf related currents and thereby clamp the voltage to within the supply rails +/- the forward diode voltage. If you are building your own motor control you should include them as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/adIDk.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="531" LastEditorUserId="531" LastEditDate="2012-12-14T22:18:24.867" LastActivityDate="2012-12-14T22:18:24.867" CommentCount="1" />

The amount of power you need to do a task is inversely proportional to the time it takes to do that task. I think it is well known that doing something faster requires more power, otherwise you could do everything infinitely fast at no cost.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computation Speed&lt;/strong&gt;. The statement about power (above) is not limited to movements. It is also true for computation. Have you noticed when your laptop is on power-saving mode, it runs slower? With processors, if you compute something twice as fast, you need four times more energy to do it. As a result, most probably, the CPU of mars rovers are also &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; working at a high speed. Therefore, if the rover needs time to process something before moving on (for example images of the environment), it needs to move slower so it would receive data at a slower rate. Slow enough so that it can process them.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stability&lt;/strong&gt;.

There are some excellent answers here, but I can add some basic rigor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason the rovers move so slow is essentially the need to be cautious with a multi-million-dollar piece of equipment. But there are some other design constraints worth mentioning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy&lt;/strong&gt; is simply the worst bottleneck for mobile, autonomous systems. The energy cost for a system to relocate across a surface can be typically modeled as&#xA;$$ \int^{T_{final}}_{T_{initial}} [ c_0 v(t)^2 + c_1 a(t)^2 + c_3v(t) + c_4a(t) + c_5v(t)*a(t) + C ]dt $$ where $c_0...c_6$ are constants representing the motor parameters (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.umn.edu/~isler/pub/icra11tokekar.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~isler/pub/iser2012solar.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&#xA;So the cost of travelling to a nearby crater is proportional to the square of the velocity and square of the acceleration. Thus, slower costs less power overall. There is usually a &quot;tipping speed&quot; at which the power consumption spikes, and this is usually a very slow speed. Thus, robots move slow to save power. Additionally, this means a robot cannot carry energy-intensive sensors like &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIDAR&quot;&gt;LIDAR&lt;/a&gt;. Note LIDAR is used extensively in autonomous, driverless vehicles like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slashgear.com/back-to-basics-how-googles-driverless-car-stays-on-the-road-09227396/&quot;&gt;Google Car&lt;/a&gt;. Which brings me to...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computational Sensing&lt;/strong&gt;. Note, we're not considering power. Now, we have to realize that the robot is &lt;em&gt;autonomous&lt;/em&gt; (i.e., driver-less). Given the reduced sensors, a robot cannot model its whole environment, and plan a large route. Think of it this way, would you run through the forest in the dark? Not if you didn't need to. The robot is constantly &quot;in the dark&quot; since it cannot see very far ahead, so it moves slowly, carefully planning each step. The memory and cpu required to plan these things is $O(r^3)$ or worse, where $r$ is the radius of planning. see &lt;a href=&quot;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=C47C6FE1DB3CE7AB3F24921BF5394BBD?doi=10.1.1.44.4807&amp;amp;rep=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1013713&amp;amp;tag=1&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication Delays&lt;/strong&gt;. As mentioned, the robot is i) autonomous, and ii), sensing-limited. The humans have to constantly &quot;check-in&quot; to make sure the robot isn't doing something stupid (despite its state of the art planning algorithms). This means the robot will wait for instructions a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;, thus slow average progress towards a goal. The previous references address this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stability&lt;/strong&gt;.

The Kinect is only a sensor, albeit a relatively powerful one for its price. To use it with a robot, you need to cover basically two bases:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get a robot that is able to interface with it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That means you need to somehow build/buy something consisting of processing unit (a microcontroller or PC) with USB connectivity and the appropriate drivers to recognize and control the Kinect (usually easier with a PC running Linux). This thing also needs to be able to provide appropriate power input to the sensor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You also want it to be able to move, so you need to add motors or other actuators to it and figure out how to get your processing unit to control them (usually easier with a microcontroller).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want it to be able to process all the data from the Kinect and make complex decisions by itself you will need enough processing power onboard (usually a PC). Otherwise, you might have to add wireless communication with other computers that will do the heavy calculations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure out how to get the Kinect data and what to do with it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft SDK is perfectly usable, as is OpenNI or libfreenect... It really comes down to what operating system is running on your robot. I am not aware of how to interface the Kinect with less powerful microcontrollers not running a popular OS (Windows/Linux/Mac) and while it may be possible it definitely is not desirable (as in it would be a lot of work for a beginner).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you've chosen which programming library and driver to use to get Kinect data, you will need to find out what you want to do with the data you get. The raw sensor data is just a range image, but some of these libraries can provide some higher-level info extracted from these range images such as skeletonized models of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In short:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start by figuring out what kind of robot you want, how you want it to move, where the Kinect will be placed and so on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choose your processing unit after searching for alternatives that are able to interface with the Kinect easily. I would suggest something like a netbook running Linux to a beginner, with a microcontroller board like the Arduino connected via USB to control motors and other low-level components of the robot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have the basic components of your robot ready (e.g. mechanical parts in place, PC running Linux, motor control working, etc) add the Kinect to the mix by connecting it to your processing unit and start working on what to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="95" LastEditorUserId="95" LastEditDate="2012-12-16T18:31:12.400" LastActivityDate="2012-12-16T18:31:12.400" CommentCount="1" />

There was nothing particularly new about Leonardo's drawings of a mechanical statue of a knight, it is just that his drawings have survived. The first 'modern' 'robot' was probably Dederick's 1868 steam man (Boilerplate is fictional). From early in the last century there have been many drawings of electromechanical men and several working ones (albeit of limited funtionality and really precursors of Disney's animatronic figures). Capek's RUR really only went along with people's fascination with robots (the robots he describes though are biological). A major advance came in the 1940s with Grey Walter's tortoises Elmer and Elsie which had simple electronic brains. The mobile robot Shakey (1966) was another 'milestone'. After that you have the walking robots from Waseda University, the subsumption (a dead end) robots from the MIT Mobile Robot Lab, and then Honda's P2 humanoid which led to a veritable explosion of humanoid robots from Japan followed by Korea and others.

If you have a number of microcontrollers, you will probably only connect one of the microcontrollers directly to the computer. The other microcontrollers will need to get their commands from the main microcontroller.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The communication you choose will depend on a number of factors:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;required bandwidth (we will assume you are running them at 16MHz)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;complexity (wiring and coding)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;bi-directional, or master-slave&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Almost all options have built-in support on the AVR microcontroller. There is no option you might reasonably prefer over the built-in options which would require additional hardware. Because they have built-in support, the software complexity is all similar, in that you just configure the port (using registers), put the data to transmit in another register, then trigger the transmission by setting a bit in another register. Any data received is found in another register, and an interrupt is triggered so you can handle it. Whichever option you choose, the only difference is the change in register locations, and some changes to the configuration registers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A USART loop has the following features:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Maximum baud rate of CLK/16 = 1MHz (at 16MHz clock) which is a transfer rate of around 90KB/s&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;fully bi-directional communications (no master or slave designation)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;requires separate wires between each pair of microcontrollers - the Atmega32u4 supports two USART ports natively, limiting the number of microcontrollers you can connect in a network in practice (or else you end up with a long string of microcontrollers - ie. connected in a linked list manner)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: this is also what you would use to get RS232 communication, except that because RS232 requires 10V, it requires a driver to get those voltage levels. For communication between microcontrollers, this is not useful (only voltage levels are changed).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RS485:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Essentially, you use the USART port in a different mode - there is no advantage in bandwidth, and it may only simplify the wiring slightly, but it also complicates it. This is not recommended.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two-wire interface:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also referred to as I2C. This means that all devices share the same two wires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need a pull-up resistor on both wires&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is slow (because the pull-up resistors are limited in value, and there is increasing capacitance as the number of devices increases, and the wire length increases). For this AVR microcontroller, the speed is up to 400 kHz - slower than USART (but this speed depends on limiting your capacitance). The reason is that although a device drives the data wire low, the opposite transition is accomplished by letting the wire float high again (the pull-up resistor).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is even slower when you consider that ALL communication shares the same limited bandwidth. Because all communication shares the same limited bandwidth, there may be delays in communication where data must wait until the network is idle before it can be sent. If other data is constantly being sent, it may also block the data from ever being sent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It does rely on a master-slave protocol, where a master addresses a slave, then sends a command/request, and the slave replies afterwards. Only one device can communicate at a time, so the slave must wait for the master to finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any device can act as both a master and/or a slave, making it quite flexible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what I would recommend/use for general communication between microcontrollers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is high speed - up to CLK/2 = 8MHz (for CLK at 16MHz), making it the fastest method. This is achievable because of its separate wire solely for the clock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MOSI, MISO data, and SCK clock wires are shared across the whole network, which means it has simpler wiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a master-slave format, but any device can be a master and/or slave. However, because of the slave select complications, for shared wiring (within the network), you should only use it in a hierarchical manner (unlike the two-wire interface). IE. if you organise all devices into a tree, a device should only be master to its children, and only a slave to its parent. That means that in slave mode, a device will always have the same master. Also, to do this correctly, you need to add resistors to MISO/MOSI/SCK to the upstream master, so that if the device is communicating downstream (when not selected as a slave), the communications will not affect communications in other parts of the network (note the number of levels you can do this using resistors is limited, see below for better solution using both SPI ports).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The AVR microcontroller can automatically tri-state the MOSI signal when it is slave-selected, and switch to slave mode (if in master).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even though it might require a hierarchical network, most networks can be organised in a tree-like manner, so it is usually not an important limitation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above can be relaxed slightly, because each AVR microcontroller supports two separate SPI ports, so each device can have different positions in two different networks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having said this, if you need many levels in your tree/hierarchy (more than 2), the above solution using resistors gets too fiddly to work. In this case, you should change the SPI network between each layer of the tree. This means each device will connect to its children on one SPI network, and its parent on the other SPI network. Although it means you only have a single tree of connections, the advantage is that a device can communicate with both one of its children and its parent at the same time and you don't have fiddly resistors (always hard to choose the right values).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it has separate MOSI and MISO wires, both the master and slave can communicate at the same time, giving it a potential factor of two increase in speed. A extra pin is required for the slave-select for each additional slave, but this is not a big burden, even 10 different slaves requires only 10 extra pins, which can be easily accommodated on a typical AVR microcontroller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAN&lt;/strong&gt; is not supported by the AVR microcontroller you have specified. As there are other good options, it is probably not important in this case anyways.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The recommendation is &lt;strong&gt;SPI&lt;/strong&gt;, because it is fast, the wiring isn't too complex, and doesn't require fiddly pull-up resistors. In the rare case where SPI doesn't fully meet your needs (probably in more complicated networks), you can use multiple options (eg. use both SPI ports, along with the two-wire interface, as well as pairing some of the microcontrollers using a USART loop!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In your case, using SPI means that naturally, the microcontroller with the USB connection to the computer can be the master, and it can just forward the relevant commands from the computer to each slave device. It can also read the updates/measurements from each slave and send these to the computer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At 8MHz, and 0.5m wire length, I don't think it will become a problem. But if it is, try be more careful of capacitance (keep ground and signal wires getting too close, and also be careful of connections between different conductors), and also signal termination. In the unlikely event that it remains a problem, you can reduce the clock rate, but I don't think it is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="145" LastEditorUserId="145" LastEditDate="2013-01-02T22:10:02.137" LastActivityDate="2013-01-02T22:10:02.137" CommentCount="12" />

In fact, this is what Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) do. This can be accomplished by using a Kalman filter. Improving accuracy helps to decrease lag, because increased accuracy reduces the dependency on a low pass filter to suppress noise. The Kalman filter fuses the data from the magnetometer, and also the gyroscope (which measures rate of change in heading).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you stick with your current compass, there are two possible solutions (Warning, this does get increasingly advanced, but option 1 should be accessible to most people without too much work).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can try to cancel out the filter. This can remove lag, but also increases high frequency noise. After doing this, you can try to control the robot based on the new estimate of heading. To do this, you must experiment to work out the low pass filter parameters. For example, in discrete time, you might find:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$\hat\theta(t)=a_0\theta(t)+a_1\theta(t-1)+\cdots+a_k\theta(t-k)$$&#xA;where $\hat\theta(t)$ is the estimated heading (compass output) at time $t$, $\theta$ is the actual heading (ground truth) at time $t$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can find the parameters $a_i$ by doing an experiment where you measure the ground truth using some other external means. Given $n+k+1$ samples, you have this equation:&#xA;$$\left[\matrix{\hat\theta(k)\\\vdots\\\hat\theta(k+n)}\right]=\left[\matrix{\theta(k)&amp;amp;\theta(k-1)&amp;amp;\cdots&amp;amp;\theta(0)\\\vdots&amp;amp;\vdots&amp;amp;&amp;amp;\vdots\\\theta(k+n)&amp;amp;\theta(k+n-1)&amp;amp;\cdots&amp;amp;\theta(n)}\right]\left[\matrix{a_0\\a_1\\\vdots\\a_k}\right]$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And you can solve by finding:&#xA;$$\left[\matrix{a_0\\a_1\\\vdots\\a_k}\right]=\left[\matrix{\theta(k)&amp;amp;\theta(k-1)&amp;amp;\cdots&amp;amp;\theta(0)\\\vdots&amp;amp;\vdots&amp;amp;&amp;amp;\vdots\\\theta(k+n)&amp;amp;\theta(k+n-1)&amp;amp;\cdots&amp;amp;\theta(n)}\right]^{+}\left[\matrix{\hat\theta(k)\\\vdots\\\hat\theta(k+n)}\right]$$ where $M^+$ is the pseudo-inverse matrix of $M$. There is no definitive way to work out $k$, so you will probably just guess. For bonus points, this assumes that the noise is white and independent, but you can whiten it first to remove bias, and therefore improve your estimate of the parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can convert this to a transfer function (also known as Z-transform in the discrete time domain):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$\frac{\hat\Theta(z)}{\Theta(z)}=a_0+a_1 z^{-1}+...+a_k z^{-k}$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To cancel this out, we can take the inverse (where $\bar\theta(t)$ is our new estimate of heading):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$\frac{\bar\Theta(z)}{\hat\Theta(z)}=\frac{1}{a_0+a_1 z^{-1}+\cdots+a_k z^{-k}}$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Converting back to the time domain:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$a_0\bar\theta(t)+a_1\bar\theta(t-1)+\cdots+a_k \bar\theta(t-k)=\hat\theta(t)$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$\bar\theta(t)=\frac{\hat\theta(t)-a_1\bar\theta(t-1)-\cdots-a_k \bar\theta(t-k)}{a_0}$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;we can then use $\bar\theta$ to control the robot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This will be very noisy, so you might want to still put $\bar\theta$ through a low-pass filter before use (although perhaps one with less lag).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above solution is still not the best way. The noisy estimate may not be very useful. If we put this into a state space equation, we can design a Kalman filter, and a full-state feedback controller using LQR (linear quadratic regulator). The combination of a Kalman filter and LQR controller is also known as an LQG controller (linear quadratic gaussian), and use loop-transfer recovery to get a good controller.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To do this, come up with the (discrete-time) state-space equations:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$\vec{x}(t)=A\vec{x}(t-1)+B\vec{u}(t-1)$, $\vec{y}(t)=C\vec{x}(t)$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;or:&#xA;$$\vec{x}(t)=\left[\matrix{\theta(t)\\\theta(t-1)\\\cdots\\\theta(t-k)}\right]=&#xA;\left[\matrix{&#xA;    A_1&amp;amp;A_2&amp;amp;\cdots&amp;amp;0&amp;amp;0&amp;amp;0\\&#xA;    1&amp;amp;0&amp;amp;\cdots&amp;amp;0&amp;amp;0&amp;amp;0\\&#xA;    0&amp;amp;1&amp;amp;\cdots&amp;amp;0&amp;amp;0&amp;amp;0\\&#xA;    \vdots&amp;amp;\vdots&amp;amp;&amp;amp;\vdots&amp;amp;\vdots&amp;amp;\vdots\\&#xA;    0&amp;amp;0&amp;amp;\cdots&amp;amp;1&amp;amp;0&amp;amp;0\\&#xA;    0&amp;amp;0&amp;amp;\cdots&amp;amp;0&amp;amp;1&amp;amp;0&#xA;}\right]&#xA;\vec{x}(t-1)&#xA;+&#xA;\left[\matrix{B_0\\B_1\\0\\\vdots\\0\\0}\right]\vec{u}(t-1)$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$\vec{y}(t)=\left[\matrix{\hat\theta(t)}\right]=\left[\matrix{a_0\\a_1\\\vdots\\a_k}\right]\vec{x}(t)$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;where $\vec{u}(t-1)$ represents the power in the motors to turn the robot, and $A_0$, $A_1$, $B_0$, $B_1$ is how much it affects the heading based on position and speed (you can choose non-zero values for the other elements of the $B$ matrix, and first row of the $A$ matrix too).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, you can build your observer (Kalman Filter), by choosing noise estimates $Q_o$ and $R_o$ for the process noise and measurement noise. The Kalman Filter can then find the optimal estimate of heading, given those assumptions about the noise. After choosing the noise estimates, the implementation just depends on implementing code for the Kalman Filter (equations can be found on Wikipedia, so I won't go over it here).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After that, you can design an LQR controller, this time, choosing $Q_c$ and $R_c$ representing the weighting given to regulating the heading, and trying to limit the use of the actuators. In this case, you might choose $Q_c = \left[\matrix{1&amp;amp;0&amp;amp;0&amp;amp;\cdots&amp;amp;0\\0&amp;amp;0&amp;amp;0&amp;amp;\cdots&amp;amp;0\\\vdots&amp;amp;\vdots&amp;amp;\vdots&amp;amp;&amp;amp;\vdots\\0&amp;amp;0&amp;amp;0&amp;amp;\cdots&amp;amp;0}\right]$ and $R_c = \left[1\right]$. This is done because LQR finds the optimal controller to minimise a cost function: $J = \sum{(\vec{x}^T Q\vec{x} + \vec{u}^T R \vec{u})}$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, you just put it through the discrete time algebraic Riccati equation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$P = Q + A^T \left( P - P B \left( R + B^T P B \right)^{-1} B^T P \right) A$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and solve for a positive definite matrix $P$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus, your control law can be given by:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$\vec{u}(t)=-K(\vec{x}(t)-\vec{x}_{ref}(t))$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;where $K = (R + B^T P B)^{-1}(B^T P A)$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, just doing this won't work very well, and is likely to be unstable because of the noise. Indeed, that means option 1 probably won't work unless you first put $\bar\theta$ through a low-pass filter (albeit not necessarily with such a long effective lag time). This is because while LQR is guaranteed stable, as soon as you use a Kalman filter, the guarantee is lost.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To fix this, we use the Loop Transfer Recovery technique, where you adjust the Kalman filter, and instead choose a new $Q_o = Q_0 + q^2BVB^T$, where $Q_0$ is your original $Q$ matrix, tuned so that the Kalman filter is optimal. $V$ is any positive definite symmetric matrix, which you can just choose as the identity matrix ($V=I$). Then, just choose a scalar $q$. The resulting controller should become (more) stable as $q \rightarrow \infty$, although the $Q_o$ matrix becomes de-tuned, which means it becomes less optimal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, you just increase $q$ until it is stable. Another way you can try to make it stable, is to increase $R_c$ (or decrease $Q_c$) to make the LQR controller slower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The concepts in this post does get quite advanced, but if you need to solve things like the Riccati equation, you can use MATLAB or other software to do this. There may also be libraries already implementing the Kalman filter (again, I believe MATLAB also does this).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For an embedded application, you may need to implement the Kalman filter yourself, although there is probably a C implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="145" LastActivityDate="2012-12-31T02:56:45.393" CommentCount="1" />

Note that it is susceptible to systematic error. For instance if you are flying a quadrotor in the presence of a fan. This would show up in your findings which is generally undesirable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With that said you could improve your estimates by using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward%E2%80%93backward_algorithm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;forward-backward algorithm&lt;/a&gt;. This algorithm is named from the fact that it consists of a forward pass and a backward pass. The forward pass is basically just an application of a Kalman-Filter, which as you may already realize, only includes data available up until the time step for which the state is being estimated. The backward pass then improves these estimates by including data available after the time in question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have only used the forward-backward algorithm with a KF (i.e. not an EKF).

The process would treat the covariance matrices for the process model (call it P) and observation models (call it O) as EM parameters and proceeds as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Start with your best guess for one of the matrices.

Imagine a bunch of your mechanical components getting jammed on each other in some gruesome fashion and busting your servos. You don't want to add insult to injury and fry your BEC in the process as well. If you don't have that number from the datasheet for the servo, you can test it by stalling a servo manually. This number can be quite a bit larger than your normal operating current, often to the point of being impractically large to design for. In the (unlikely) event that you can somehow prove that given servos in your application will never be placed in a stall condition, you can skimp on that a bit. Keep in mind that a servo doesn't have to be actively moving on its own to be stalled; a force trying to move it from its set position can do it as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second, softer requirement is your real-world operating current, which is a lot more application-specific. The amount of current drawn by a motor is dependent on the amount of torque it is exerting to move the load. Measure the current drawn by each servo while moving its real-world load. Add those up for any given group of servos that might be moving at the same time. The largest of those is your maximum normal operating current.

If you have 4 servos that are in use at one time, that draw an amp each, you need 4 amps, period. BECs are convenience components, that are used because R/C servos used to burn out if provided with more than 5 volts. 6 Nicad batteries, which was the most common configuration before LiPo technology came around,  worked out to 9.6 volts (6 X 1.2v). BECs are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__112__182__ESC_UBEC_VR-VR_UBEC.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;available&lt;/a&gt; in many sizes, and greater than 3.5 amps is common. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the requirement is greater than what is available, you simply provide your own voltage/amperage to the servos - often straight from a 6v battery, again the BEC is/was just a convenience component. If you do this with excessive current (more than the controller can pass through) you need to remove the red wire from the plug that goes into the controller, and supply voltage via that red wire. the black wire, needs to be both a ground connection for the signal, so it can not be removed from the controller, but it also needs to be the negative connection for power. The need to do this is pretty uncommon. The controller power connections are just straight pass through.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are using a plain R/C receiver the rule of thumb is the circuit board can handle about 6 amps max.

There doesn't seem to be any study directly investigating if and how the uncanny valley applies to autistic children. At least, a Google Scholar search with the keywords &lt;a href=&quot;http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=autism%20%22uncanny%20valley%22&quot;&gt;autism &quot;uncanny valley&quot;&lt;/a&gt; doesn't result in anything of the sort. I agree, though, that this would be a most interesting and useful area of research. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, however, that, despite the fMRI and other studies, the Uncanny Valley is far from considered an established theory. This is, partly, because the Uncanny Valley is likely a great deal more complex than Mori first proposed, that is, it is probably not just human likeness that affects our sense of familiarity, nor is familiarity the only factor affected (MacDorman, 2006). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my personal opinion, there's no doubt something like the Uncanny Valley exists, even though it may not quite take the shape Mori gave it (Bartneck et al., 2007). Artists of all ilk have long been aware of it and have deliberately used it (e.g. Chucky or any zombie movie ever) or suffered when falling into it (the Polar Express being the most notable example). Several explanations have been put forward to explain it (Brenton et al., 2005; MacDorman, 2005; Saygin et al., 2010) and it's been observed in monkeys as well (Steckenfinger and Ghazanfar, 2009), so it's very likely evolutionary in nature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in this area, I'd probably look at how people suffering from autism process faces in general. In this area, there have been a number of studies using real faces (e.g. Scholar search &lt;a href=&quot;http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=autism%20%22facial%20features%22&quot;&gt;autism &quot;facial features&quot;&lt;/a&gt;), as well as artificial faces (e.g. Scholar search &lt;a href=&quot;http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=autism%20cartoon%20faces&quot;&gt;autism cartoon faces&lt;/a&gt;). This difference in decoding facial expressions might explain why they seem to not feel the effects of the uncanny valley the same way other people do. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for Kaspar in particular, Blow et al. (2006) goes into some detail on the design decisions involved in Kaspar's face. Also, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdF7TwhUgLY&quot;&gt;YouTube video&lt;/a&gt;, Kaspar's creators cite predictability and simplicity as some of the reasons for his particular design.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;References:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;SA Steckenfinger,  AA Ghazanfar. &quot;Monkey visual behavior falls into the uncanny valley.&quot; Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 106.43 (2009): 18362-18366.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;M Blow et al. &quot;Perception of robot smiles and dimensions for human-robot interaction design.&quot; Robot and Human Interactive Communication, 2006.

Soon that grew into a method where those process could communicate within the same computer or on to a physically separate computer. And then high efficiency versions of that became the basis for ROS and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/robotics/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Microsoft RDS&lt;/a&gt;.

While AI has made great strides it has generally been unable to handle the complexity of the world. A common solution this problem has been to restrict autonomous robots to very simplified versions of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Roomba is a good example. It deals with the complexity of the world by essentially executing combinations of simple patterns (spirals, straight lines, etc.) where transitions between patterns are a function of obstacle presence and time. This has its benefits. For instance the Roomba only needs a hand full of bump and IR sensors to perceive its world which in turn limits the amount of processing power required.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The exception at the moment is autonomous vehicles. This comes predominantly from the large investments the military has been making over the years. Not only in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) but also ground based vehicles. Widely known examples of these investments include the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Grand_Challenge&quot;&gt;DARPA Grand Challenge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.darpa.mil/grandchallenge/&quot;&gt;DARPA Urban Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.

For instance the motion planning techniques are usually applicable to robots with other methods of locomotion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other types of autonomous robots are on the horizon because of similar investments.

I am not thoroughly familiar with the Japanese culture, but they certainly seem to have a knack for robots that mimic a human.

These work on minimizing the error of a pose constraint network. You can think of it this way: There are a number of reference frames (your vertices) and then you have knowledge on the transformation between these frames. These transformations are associated with an uncertainty. &lt;a href=&quot;http://ais.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/publications/papers/kuemmerle11icra.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pose graph optimization frameworks&lt;/a&gt; like e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://openslam.org/toro.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;TORO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://openslam.org/hog-man.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;HogMan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://openslam.org/g2o.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;G2O&lt;/a&gt; and so on will then give you the maximum likelihood of your vertex positions, given the constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In practical robot terms, this usually means:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Each robot pose $p_k$ at time $k$ has its own reference frame and hence vertex&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Depending on you approach, you can also add landmarks as vertices. You don't have to however. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Whenever you get new information on the relation between two poses, you add that to the constraint graph. E.g. your odometry will give you a transform between $p_k$ and $p_{k+1}$. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If your approach works landmark based, you add transformations to your landmarks. If you only know the position to your landmark, you set a high uncertainty on the rotation information of your transformation. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If your approach does not know about landmarks, e.g. you have large pointclouds that you match with ICP, you can add the ICP results to your constraint graph.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The pose constraints are usuall stored as sparse matrices of size $n \times n$ where $n$ is the number of vertices (again robot poses and landmarks) in your graph. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The file format itself provides initial guesses for the position of the vertices with the &lt;code&gt;VERTEX2&lt;/code&gt; (for 2D models) and &lt;code&gt;VERTEX3&lt;/code&gt; (for 3D models). You can't mix the two. &#xA;Constraints are added so that you specify the transform between the reference frames (vertices) given by &lt;code&gt;from_id&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;to_id&lt;/code&gt;. The transform is given by either &lt;code&gt;EDGE2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;EDGE3&lt;/code&gt; as translation and rotation in euler angles, as well as the information matrix of the uncertainty. In this case the information matrix is the inverse of the covariance matrix for the transform vector $[x\, y \, z\, \text{roll}\, \text{pitch}\, \text{yaw}]$. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Depending on your framework, usually one of the vertices is grounded in a global reference frame. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Graph based pose graph optimizers are considered SLAM backends. How you generate the constraints e.g. from you range data is a front-end problem.

Your vehicle would bump up to buffer, detect that it wasn't moving and take that as a signal that it had reached the end of travel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you you are moving slowly, with low toque and the restraining force of the buffer is significantly greater than the motive force of the vehicle plus the force from dissipating the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;momentum&lt;/a&gt; of the vehicle, then a simple mechanical &lt;em&gt;endstop&lt;/em&gt; might be sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to get a little more sophisticated, you could add a mechanical switch to your vehicle &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumper_%28automobile%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;bumpers&lt;/a&gt;, ideally on a spring such that it is closed before the main body of the vehicle hits the buffer. When the buffer stop is close, the control system would be told by the closing of the switch that and could apply the brakes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Magnetic&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;magnetic endstop&lt;/em&gt; would be a magnet on the track with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_switch&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reed-switch&lt;/a&gt; attached to your control system. When the reed switch rolls over the magnet, the circuit is closed and the control system can stop the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This has the advantage over the mechanical switch that it is non contact, so is less likely to be damages if the vehicle becomes a run-away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Optical&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;em&gt;optical endstop&lt;/em&gt; would be an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.micromo.com/why-stepper-motors-lose-steps.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;slotted optical switch&lt;/a&gt; on the vehicle and a blade of metal near the end of travel on the track, which runs through optical switch, blocking the beam when the vehicle gets close to the end of travel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This has the advantage that rather than relying on a magnet that is in one spot on the track being detected, it can signal an end of travel condition for the whole distance from the end of required travel right up to any mechanical endstop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Soft endstops&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, this is just keeping track of where you have commanded your stepper motor to move and applying limits on how far you allow the higher level software to move. If you are requesting motion which is well within the parameters of the motor you have specified for your vehicle (speed, torque and acceleration profile etc.), then it should not be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.micromo.com/why-stepper-motors-lose-steps.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;skipping steps&lt;/a&gt; and soft end-stops may well be sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you do this though, I would also recommend adding one of the other mechanisms as &lt;a href=&quot;http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/belt+and+braces&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;belt and braces&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Combinations&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most industrial systems have multiple end of travel detection and over travel prevention systems, usually soft limits and either a &lt;a href=&quot;http://reprap.org/wiki/Mechanical_Endstop&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;mechanical endstop&lt;/a&gt; plus &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_switch&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;limit switches&lt;/a&gt; or soft limits, mechanical endstop plus &lt;a href=&quot;http://reprap.org/wiki/OptoEndstop_2.1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;opto endstop&lt;/a&gt;.

If there was wheel slip to account for, weight would be a factor there. However, given your gear rack track, wheel slip is negligible and can be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've built small line-follower robots in the past using 5V geared stepper motors running off AA batteries. Wheel slip was fairly small due to rubber O-rings mounted to the wheels. We took two identical prototypes and set them side by side and sent a move forward signal to both simultaneously. They moved in perfect lockstep over the course of a meter. We then placed a glass bottle of beer on one of the robots and repeated the experiment. Same result despite the weight difference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The specifications for your stepper motor will list a &lt;b&gt;Step Angle&lt;/b&gt;, the number of degrees that the motor shaft turns for a single step (I'm assuming that you're not doing any microstepping). You then need to account for the gear ratio to figure out how far you actually move. This is a little trickier to calculate with a rack and pinion than a normal pair of spur gears. Gear ratio is normally determined by the diameter of the input and output gears, but your output gear (the rack) is technically of infinite diameter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you haven't already, set up your control code so that you can make your stepper motor turn a given number of steps. Suppose the step angle of your motor is 7.5 degrees. The number of steps required to turn 360 degrees is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;360&amp;deg; / 7.5&amp;deg; per step = 48 steps&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can verify your 360 degree turn code by by placing a small mark on the pinion gear. Now set your robot on the rack and measure how far it travels along the rack when you turn the motor 360 degrees (48 steps in this case). You can use this measurement to determine how far along the rack the robot moves per step. Suppose it travels 12 centimeters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;12 cm / 48 steps = &lt;b&gt;0.25 cm of linear motion per step&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Try the track measurement again with the maximum water load and verify that a 360 degree turn of the pinion gear still occurs. If not, you are trying to step too fast for the motor torque to keep up and it's missing steps. Increase the interval between steps until you get a full 360 degree turn of the pinion gear with the water weight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can now encode movements to 0.25 cm resolution. If you know the length of the track and can guarantee your start position, you can get away with not having an endstop or limit switch. That being said, it's always a good idea to have them there anyways just in case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="308" LastEditorUserId="308" LastEditDate="2013-01-22T03:49:18.343" LastActivityDate="2013-01-22T03:49:18.343" CommentCount="0" />

Knowing the number of ticks per revolution, and wheel size, you can get accurate odometry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another solution that may work for you is add on encoders for DC motors. Their original intent is to make a regular motor a Servo motors, but would work great for this task as well.

This is not exactly my area of expertise, but let me give you a few pointers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A very common approach for controlling manipulators is to first design good joint velocity controllers, in the &quot;multiple SISO&quot; approach you mention. You would then use inverse kinematics to determine at each point in time what the joint velocities should be ideally to reach your desired end-effector pose.  Assuming your joint velocity control loop dynamics are fast enough, you should be able to achieve those velocities. The kinematic model of manipulators is usually obtained in terms of Denavit–Hartenberg parameters. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Considering that it is frequently done for robots and probably is enough for your purposes, I suggest you take that approach. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a non-linear control class I took we saw a MIMO model for robot manipulators. I am not 100% sure about this, but I think you might want to use this if you are interested in modeling not only kinematics but also dynamics. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main difference is that in this scenario the joint positions and velocities all affect the inertia matrix, Coriolis and centrifugal forces and damping in a non-linear and usually not separable fashion. So you would not only have to get used to MIMO control, but would have to look into non-linear control as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I said, it's not my area of expertise so if someone thinks I said any gibberish I would be gladly corrected.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="95" LastActivityDate="2013-01-24T15:38:51.320" CommentCount="1" />

When your sensor is at rest, you measure the acceleration from the force that you use to counteract the gravitational force. This is how you can fix your orientation vs the gravity vector. When the sensor is accelerated, as would be the case when other external forces (like e.g. wind) are applied it gets mixed with the forces counteracting the gravity, and you can not uniquely identify the gravity vector anymore. When averaged over time you can smooth out the dynamic acceleration components, and this is for example what is used in an AHRS to compensate the gyro drift. For short term estimation - which is what you are asking for - an accelerometer is not likely to provide you the information that you need to keep your craft stable, and you need some other method to estimate your orientation (e.g. gyros, horizon sensor, etc...). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Effectively you can not differentiate between a level craft which is accelerated by a wind gust and a craft which is tilted, but otherwise not accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="127" LastActivityDate="2013-02-05T12:53:26.347" CommentCount="1" />

The accelerometer will be almost useless to detect rotations on a platform that's experiencing unknown accelerations. Your plane will be subject to two force vectors: gravity and lift+drag. Lift+drag will vary hugely as a function of the plane's pitch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But here's a more general way you can know this is impossible, and you can use this method in many other cases than just IMUs. A sensor, or set of sensors gives you N values. You can't interpret this into a space with more than N dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A trivial example: You want a sensor to measure someone's position within a room. Would a single ultrasonic range finder be sufficient? No. A position in a room requires two values, (X, Y) coordinates. But an ultrasonic sensor gives you only one value, a length. There is no way to set up this sensor to solve your problem. But if you had two sensors, then it might be possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now let's look at the plane. A non-accelerating plane is subject to one force only, gravity. The direction of gravity relative to the plane is a 3D vector, but luckily (if you're on Earth) you know its magnitude. That's 1 value, leaving 2 unknowns, so you could theoretically get away with a 2-axis accelerometer to make up those 2 unknowns and calculate the vector of gravity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What about a plane in flight. Gravity and lift+drag are both 3D vectors, giving you 6 numbers. OK you know the magnitude of gravity, so 5 numbers. You'll need some kind of sensor that gives you at least 5 values. Therefore a 3-axis accelerometer cannot be enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While neither a 3-axis gyro nor a 3-axis accelerometer will be enough on their own, the gyro would be much more useful. This is because it's directly measuring rotations, which is the very thing you're trying to control. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the accelerometer will be more useful for detecting and correcting deviations from travel in a straight line.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="40" LastEditorUserId="40" LastEditDate="2013-02-08T10:25:38.283" LastActivityDate="2013-02-08T10:25:38.283" />

According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_Robotics.html?id=MqMeAQAAIAAJ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Craig 2005&lt;/a&gt;, robot manipulators can be reasonably decomposed into &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prismatic_joint&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;prismatic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolute_joint&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;revolute&lt;/a&gt; joints. Each such joint is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_%28mechanics%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;one degree of freedom&lt;/a&gt; in your &lt;em&gt;input&lt;/em&gt; space. That is, a hand on the end of the robot can be specified by a vectors of length $N$, where the robot has $N$ joints of types prismatic or revolute. OK. we can now specify the manipulator position. The set of all possible configurations is called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_space&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;configuration space&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Let's assume we know this completely, as you stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defining the task&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Let's assume that the task consists of moving the manipulator through a series of stages. For example, suppose the manipulator must drill 30 holes in a sheet, then place the sheet on a pallet, or whatever. Since we have the manipulator positions as a vector of length $N$, we can specify each task as a desired position, $X_1, X_2 ... X_M$ for task length $M$. What we've just done is specified a series of points in the &lt;em&gt;configuration space&lt;/em&gt; which we defined above. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OK break time to verify the terminology if anyone is confused. Watch this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciSaT0eH5cY&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;. The robot has 3 degrees of freedom (each rotation point), so the configuration space is all sets of 3 real numbers (in the range 0-$2\pi$, corresponding to the 3 angles of the 3 revolute joints). The task is to cause the end-effector (the pen) to visit all points on a circle. If this isn't clear, I can clarify.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defining the cost&lt;/strong&gt; Now that we know the configuration space and the series of points, let's talk about cost. The cost is typically the force exerted by the joints. So suppose (a huge assumption), that we can model this directly as $f(X_1,X_2)$, a function which returns the energy to go from state $1$ to $2$. If we're lucky, the function is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_%28mathematics%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;metric&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If not, it defines &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a complete graph with $N\choose 2$&lt;/a&gt; links (the cost to go from any state to any other state).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defining the problem&lt;/strong&gt; Find the optimal ordering of manipulator states and paths between manipulator states to minimize the cost, $f(X_i,X_{i+1})$ for each sequential task $i$. This is clearly a Travelling Salesperson Problem &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;(See: TSP)&lt;/a&gt;. Since TSP is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hard&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;NP-Hard&lt;/a&gt;, this problem is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-complete#Formal_definition_of_NP-completeness&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;NP-Complete&lt;/a&gt;*.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What does the above mean? Well, for a &lt;em&gt;given&lt;/em&gt; robot design, we have arrive at an NP-Complete problem to derive the optimal task sequence: movements, manipulator positions, etc. To optimize the &lt;em&gt;robot itself&lt;/em&gt; is even more difficult. First, we have to search over all possible robot configurations (subject to what??), and for each, solve an NP-Complete problem. The best result is the robot configuration we want.  For a small-dimensional workspace (say one joint, or $N=1$), and a simple task (say a small number of possitions like $M$=3 or so) this is not too difficult. However, in general, $N$ is unbounded, and $M$ is large. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if there is some &lt;em&gt;ordering&lt;/em&gt; property on $N$, like a robot of 2 joints is better than a robot of 1 joints, etc, you still have to do $\log(n^\star)$ TSP solutions, where $n^\star$ is the perfect number of robot joints. Remember a TSP solution is incredibly difficult to solve optimally. This gets even worse if we want to say &quot;Well, what about two arms with two joints versus one arm with four joints.&quot;  I don't want to talk about that complexity ... It's exploding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, because you can't solve it perfectly using computers, people pay big money to have an experienced engineer do it for them. Win-win?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*well not really, but along the way we show a polynomial time reduction, so it sorta counts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt; What we actually did here was describe the algorithm to select the optimal manipulator design. That should answer your first question. However, it is computationally infeasible to run on a computer, and so heuristics and other design choices are necessary, that should answer your second question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What this means: We're also having this problem in our lab. Manipulators are very expensive, and we want one that is &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; good enough to perform some task. What we converged to was an extremely minimal set of joints for each task, instead of one large and capable manipulator for all tasks.

The unit of power is the joule per second (J/s), known as the watt ...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Energy transfer can be used to do work, so power is also the rate at which this work is performed. The same amount of work is done when carrying a load up a flight of stairs whether the person carrying it walks or runs, but more power is expended during the running because the work is done in a shorter amount of time. The output power of an electric motor is the product of the torque the motor generates and the angular velocity of its output shaft. The power expended to move a vehicle is the product of the traction force of the wheels and the velocity of the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The integral of power over time defines the work done. Because this integral depends on the trajectory of the point of application of the force and torque, this calculation of work is said to be &quot;path dependent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia Torque&lt;/a&gt; page:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Torque, moment or moment of force (see the terminology below), is the tendency of a force to rotate an object about an axis,&lt;a href=&quot;http://robotics.stackexchange.com/a/914/37&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; fulcrum, or pivot. Just as a force is a push or a pull, a torque can be thought of as a twist to an object. Mathematically, torque is defined as the cross product of the lever-arm distance and force, which tends to produce rotation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Loosely speaking, torque is a measure of the turning force on an object such as a bolt or a flywheel. For example, pushing or pulling the handle of a wrench connected to a nut or bolt produces a torque (turning force) that loosens or tightens the nut or bolt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The symbol for torque is typically $\boldsymbol{\tau}$, the Greek letter tau. When it is called moment, it is commonly denoted $M$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The magnitude of torque depends on three quantities: the force applied, the length of the lever arm connecting the axis to the point of force application, and the angle between the force vector and the lever arm. ...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The SI unit for torque is the newton metre (N·m).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque#Relationship_between_torque.2C_power.2C_and_energy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Relationship between torque, power, and energy&lt;/a&gt; you get the formula: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Power is the work per unit time, given by $$P = \boldsymbol{\tau} \cdot \boldsymbol{\omega}$$ where $P$ is power, $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ is torque, $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ is the angular velocity, and $\cdot$ represents the scalar product.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="37" LastEditorUserId="37" LastEditDate="2013-02-13T01:25:46.573" LastActivityDate="2013-02-13T01:25:46.573" />

I have an idea for the design, but since this is my first time doing something like this I have made &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt; of assumptions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I decided to choose the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__13360__TGY_S4505B_40g_4_8kg_0_10sec_Dual_Bearing_Analog_Servo.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;TGY-S4505B&lt;/a&gt; servos as my motor system. I intend to attach these servos to &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.kornylak.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=FXA308B&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;FXA308B&lt;/a&gt; wheels. Finally, I intend to power my servos with one &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__25030__Turnigy_LSD_6_0V_2300mAh_Ni_MH_Flat_Receiver_Pack.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Turnigy LSD 6.0V 2300mAh Ni-MH Flat Receiver Packs&lt;/a&gt; (not sure if LiPo is a better choice). I need to be able to run the servos continuously for roughly 8 minutes. You can ignore the microcontroller and other stuff, relatively speaking they will consume much less power. The robot will have four wheels (thus, four servos).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The basic specifications of each servo is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Type: Analog&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Gear train: Plastic&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bearings: Dual&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Motor Type: Carbon Brushed&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Weight: 40g (1.41oz)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lead: 30cm&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Torque: 3.9kg.cm @ 4.8v / 4.8kg.cm @ 6v&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Speed: 0.13sec 60°@ 4.8v / 0.10 60° @ 6v&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So based on my battery pack, I will be running the servos at 6V. That gives me a speed of 60 degrees per 0.10 seconds. I plan on modifying these servos for continuous rotation, and connected them directly to the wheel. Since the wheel has a diameter of ~5 cm, it has a circumference of ~15 cm. Based on these specs, it seems to me that my robot can move at roughly 15 cm/0.6 seconds, or 25 cm/s (quite fast actually). I don't intend to run it constantly at that speed, so in the 8 minute run, assume my average speed to be 20 cm/s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are these assumptions reasonable, and are the calculations correct?

With the baseline you control how much accuracy you get with distance. Wider baseline results in higher disparity values and thus less noise on the distance estimation. Higher baseline also means that you will get a reduced overlap between your field of views. Most importantly though, the wider the baseline the harder the matching between the two views. So the quality of the result goes down.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;shutter - always use a global shutter for anything with computer vision on mobile robots&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;resolution - most stereo algorithms are computationally expensive. And you will likely not need that many 3d points. In the near field the sampling density is usually enough, and the far field your error from the low disparity is more of a problem than sampling density. 640x480 is fine in most cases. Some chips have a wider aspect ratio, which is favourable for the overlap, but you can get the same with using a sub-window of your chip.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;objectives/field of view - for mobile outdoor robots I prefer a wide field of view over narrow objectives. More or less for the same reasons as the resolution. Make sure your objectives are rigid and have a means to fixate any moving parts e.g. like adjustable focal length. In most cases a fixed focal length is fine anyway, since you are limited by the selection of your baseline.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;trigger - when you create your own stereo rig, your cameras should support hardware trigger and ideally one should trigger the other.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;framerate - In my opinion the least important consideration. Unless you have a lot of processing power you won't be getting much more than something like 5 Hz anyway. So your algorithm is much more likely to be the bottleneck, rather than the chip or the connection.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;interface - Most cameras come with Firewire/USB2/USB3/Ethernet. USB2 is useless as it consumes a lot of CPU. Firewire is good if you have a port, but I think it seems to be on the decline in favour of USB3 these days. Didn't have much experience with USB3 yet. Ethernet is quite nice because you are more likely to find embedded systems with GigEthernet than USB3 at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;housing - as rigid as possible.

From experience with this, here are the most important things. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synchronization&lt;/strong&gt;. The camera must be 100% synced. For example, say the UGV is driving at a modest 36Km/hr (10m/s)  and recording frames at 30 frames per second. That is, at every frame the UGV would cover 3m. Now, say your sync is off by 1ms, one of the cameras will be off by ~0.3m, which is bad [just off the top of my head]. Sync problems are very hard to detect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolution&lt;/strong&gt;. In the context of stereo, we refer to depth resolution, or how much depth can we resolve given a change in disparity. An excellent explanation can be found here &lt;a href=&quot;http://pub1.willowgarage.com/~konolige/svs/disparity.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://pub1.willowgarage.com/~konolige/svs/disparity.htm&lt;/a&gt; The equation you want to look at is a function of the focal length of the image and the stereo baseline. $\delta Z = \frac{Z^2}{Bf}\delta d$. This says that depth resolving power $\delta Z$ is inversely proportional to the baseline $B$ times the focal length $f$. That is the longer the baseline, the smaller $\delta Z$, the better. Meaning, you can resolve more depth. The minimum change in disparity $\delta d$ is controlled partially by the image resolution and the algorithm used. For your calculations, you can safely assume that $\delta d$ is at least $1/2$. It is better to be conservative with the choice of $\delta d$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overlap&lt;/strong&gt;. You want to have overlap between the cameras to get stereo. Hence, you need to choose a combination of lens focal length (field of view) and baseline so that you have enough overlap for the application. Basically, trigonometry work on the board, or a quick matlab/python script.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For UGV's, there are two uses for stereo. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navigation and Pose Estimation&lt;/strong&gt; In this case you most probably need a large baseline + long focal length. This allows the stereo to see and resolve depth better and longer range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obstacle detection and avoidance&lt;/strong&gt; You will probably need a shorter baseline and wider lens (smaller focal length) so that  you can focus on things very close to you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some UGV's might have both stereo setups, the large baseline narrow field of view for navigation and another one or two for obstacle avoidance. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Be very careful what you buy. Some companies offer already built stereo setups. Those are great on the robustness side of things, they don't loose calibration easily and are always in sync. The problem is that the commercially available ones have a small baseline. If you want to build your own. I'm guessing you will end up doing so, make sure the camera are &lt;em&gt;syncable&lt;/em&gt;. Firewire is great for this, two camera on the same bus will sync with 125microsecond accuracy out of the box! USB and Gige cams are painful to sync.  When you put everything together, you want to make sure that the lenses are not going to move at all, and the baseline is rigid, very rigid for the application. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also be careful in lens selection. Not all lenses work with all cameras. Lenses have a resolution too.

Let's say the environment is also bounded by a special polygon. We have something like the following. To decompose this space, we simply add vertical edges between every vertex and the nearest line or vertex.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.jvanderhook.info/images/slabs/drawing_1.png&quot; height=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.jvanderhook.info/images/slabs/drawing_2.png&quot; height=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.jvanderhook.info/images/slabs/drawing_3.png&quot; height=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.jvanderhook.info/images/slabs/drawing_4.png&quot; height=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To accomplish this in code, you need only a line-segment intersection test, a sorted list of edges, and a sorted list of vertices. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From every vertex $v_i$ in left-to-right order,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Create a vertical line $l_i$ at each $v_i$, extended until the first edge or vertex it intersects&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;At each intersection, create a new vertex. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When this is done, the set of new edges and vertices encloses only trapezoids. But I emphasize, you can't do this &lt;em&gt;online&lt;/em&gt; (without prior knowledge of the obstacles). If you want to do robust coverage without prior knowledge, you might look at &quot;bug algorithms.&quot; In particular, here's a simple algorithm, assuming the environment is bounded.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the start position, move up and left until you reach the upper-left corner of the environment. If you encounter an obstacle first, you must travel around it. You know something is an obstacle if it can be circumnavigated (bump and move).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the upper left, move right until you encounter the boundary. Then move down and left (We're doing a boustrophedon of the entire space).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you are on a left-right line and encounter an obstacle, you have two options.  (i) We can circumnavigate until we reach the left-right line we are trying to cover, then continue.  (ii), We can turn around and cover a new left-right line until we find our way past the obstacle or end up in this situation again.  I'll illustrate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.jvanderhook.info/images/bou_cart2.png&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;Option 2&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.jvanderhook.info/images/bou_cart.png&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;Option 2&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the left, we move around the obstacle until we can return to the &quot;line&quot; we were trying to follow. On the right, we continue covering the (smaller) area on the one side of the obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The advantage of the first method is you always map out the obstacle completely before you make a decision about how to get around it, thus you can take the shorter path. The advantage of the second method is you don't have to get around the obstacle at all, you can just proceed to cover the area you are in. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that this defines your boustrophedon decomposition in an online way&lt;/em&gt;: You cover the area between the obstacles or between the obstacles and the boundary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, as far as I know, the first method is easier to analyze. The more complicated algorithms (like BFS, etc), are chosen either because the environment is unbounded (you don't want to spend forever looking for a boundary), or there is a really nasty obstacle in the way that basically partitions the environment.  Why is this bad? look at this example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.jvanderhook.info/images/bou_cart3.png&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moving left-right, then circling each obstacle produces &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; too many covers of the small parts between each obstacle. In fact, without global path planning, you can make this as bad as the resolution of your grid by placing these columns 1 px wide, as tall as the entire environment and 1 px apart. Then you'd have to move around the obstacle each time you hit it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is why I asked if you had some idea of where you were in the environment or could do global path planning. But the &lt;em&gt;online&lt;/em&gt; vs &lt;em&gt;offline&lt;/em&gt; discussion and optimal algorithms for this is not what you really wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="163" LastEditorUserId="163" LastEditDate="2013-02-21T04:37:49.780" LastActivityDate="2013-02-21T04:37:49.780" CommentCount="2" />

I looked up the MPU-6050 specs and I am unsure whether it integrates a digital compass to combat gyro drift.  On Sparkfun, it refers to it being a '9 axis fusion algorithm' which implies compass (three axis each for gyro, accel, and magento) but elsewhere it only refers to gyro and accel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was doing some related work with a Pololu MinIMU-9 which has all nine axis but requires you to implement the IMU integration logic in code.  What I found with that part was that placing it within 10 cm of the drive motors was causing the magnometer to be very difficult to use.  On one hand you can do a calibration and remove the static magnetic fields from your reading (assuming your IMU routines are coded for this).  On the other hand, I was finding that the strength of the static motor fields was so strong that the comparatively weaker Earth's magnetic fields were down in the 'noise'.  I was having to tune down the flux sensitivity to handle the drive field so my sensitivity to the Earth's field also dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This fix was to ensure the magnometer was sufficiently far away from the drives that their fields were sufficiently smaller than the Earth's fields.  In my case I had to move the IMU sensor about 50 cm away from the motors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So in summary, 'it depends' :-)  It depends on your sensors, the strength of your local magnetic fields, and whether you can calibrate out the local fields in your IMU logic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="35" LastActivityDate="2013-02-24T04:49:28.030" />

As I've always understood it, the two tripod style gait is known as a statically stable gait, while a good walking biped like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bostondynamics.com/robot_petman.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Petman&lt;/a&gt; uses a dynamically stable gait. Never heard of a dynamically unstable gait. That sounds more like drunkenness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two legs on the ground is probably the lower limit for this design of robot. Generally, it's easier to make this work with tall, humanoid robots, which take a long time to fall over. Wide flat robots need to lift and place their feet pretty quickly if they aren't leaving many on the floor. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But how to develop a gair for your robot. Firstly, you should decide what you want to achieve from the gait. Are you looking for maximum speed on a flat surface, or maximum stability on uneven surfaces?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your goal is stability, then I certainly think it's worth having the robot be aware of its centre of gravity in relation to its feet. To help it know this, it might even be worth adding some force sensors to its feet so it can calculate this easily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your goal is maximum speed only, then I'd simply concentrate on funding an optimum gait pattern. This is harder to do. There are two good ways to approach it:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modelling. Create a comprehensive computer model of the robot, including mass, stiffness, torque, etc. Use this model to fully understand the dynamic behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trial and error. You can do this the hard way, programming in random gaits, adjusting them on a hunch and measuring their performance. Try making it walk both forwards, and diagonally. Or you can use a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;genetic algorithm&lt;/a&gt; to help you automatically search for better gaits. The difficulty of using a GA is that you need to have some way to automatically measure the performance of the gait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A third way, is to make the robot into a scientist who runs concious experiments on itself to validate hypotheses about itself, and work out how to walk, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNL5-0_T1D0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cornell University's starfish robot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="40" LastActivityDate="2013-02-24T21:55:27.547" />

That is, you predict that the next state is one which is reachable given your current kinematic constraints. I'll reiterate: &lt;em&gt;this is not  a hard constraint on the filter output&lt;/em&gt;. It simply makes unreachable states unlikely, with only the granularity available to the 2-D Gaussian distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, the sensors are used to find which &lt;em&gt;of the predicted states&lt;/em&gt; are likely &lt;em&gt;given given the new information&lt;/em&gt; (GPS, etc). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; apply a kinematic model as a &lt;em&gt;constraint&lt;/em&gt; (i.e., we &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; consider any state outputs which violate the kinematic model), then I know of only one option off hand: Use a particle filter to sample all nearby states, then apply a zero weight to all states which are not reachable given your Kinematics. Note, a particle filter is a general term with lots of different meanings. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A particle can represent all positions, $x,y,\theta$, e.g., a grid over the environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A particle can represent all &lt;em&gt;nearby&lt;/em&gt; positions. In this case you sample the kinematic model many times with some noise, and propagate those forward. This implicitly honors the kinematic constraint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A particle can represent possible &lt;em&gt;paths&lt;/em&gt; (i.e., &lt;a href=&quot;http://robots.stanford.edu/papers/montemerlo.fastslam-tr.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;fastslam&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, you can re-weight each particle according to it's probability given the GPS measurements. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I recommend you use the INS in place of the wheel odometry during the prediction step. It will likely be a reasonable proxy, especially over the short term. In fact, this is a very common practice in the literature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To make this clearer, you predict your next pose $x^+$, based on your current pose $x^-$, and your INS measurement which gives you a $\delta x$ (because you integrate the accellerations). So your EKF_PREDICT function goes from:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$x_{t+1|t} = f_{kinematics}(x_{t}, u_t)$, with odometry $u_t$ instead of the control vector.

The difference in voltage between the two sets of cells will impact your available operating time, so it will make sense to manually balance the voltages (using 3.2V parallel charging) every so often.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="350" LastEditorUserId="350" LastEditDate="2013-03-06T18:16:31.927" LastActivityDate="2013-03-06T18:16:31.927" CommentCount="4" />

However, this is easy for short distances, and should be at least considered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the distance is too far for only odometry, one should consider using some sensor to measure turns (for instance, a &lt;strong&gt;gyroscope or compass&lt;/strong&gt;).  Turns tend to introduce the most error in odometry (measuring along a straight line doesn't have too much error), so using a sensor for turns can sometimes make odometry a viable solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If odometry or odometry + sensed turning doesn't work, then we get to be creative.  If you want the robot to follow a path composed of mostly straight segments, you could place &lt;strong&gt;IR LEDs&lt;/strong&gt; at given &quot;waypoints&quot; on the table, and have the robot sense those LEDs and drive towards each waypoint in series.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, that still leaves some visual marking on the table (although it could be disguised to some extent), and it would be great to be able to do without that.

However, assume that the servo is holding a weight at a distance (so it is acting against gravity), which means an approximately constant torque load. In this case, if the position error is zero and the servo is at rest, then each of P, I and D components are zero, which means the exerted torque is zero. This would cause the weight to sink, which is countered by the error in its position causing P,I components to increase. Wouldn't this situation cause the lifted weight to oscillate and balance at a constant position which is significantly different from the goal position? This isn't the case with the videos of servos I have seen lifting weights. Or is this the case and friction is smoothing everything out?

My knowledge of controls is spotty, too.  Thus... take this with a grain of salt. &lt;code&gt;:)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To keep the robot upright (and still), you're trying to stabilize (send to $0$) the state $x$, where:&#xA;$$x=\left[\begin{array}{c}\text{leftVelocity} \\ \text{rightVelocity} \\ \text{angle from vertical}\end{array}\right]$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, when this system is stable, the left and right wheel velocities will be $0$.  So, we want an offset for the target speed:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$x_{new}=\left[\begin{array}{c}\text{leftVelocity}-\delta_L \\ \text{rightVelocity}-\delta_R \\ \text{angle from vertical}\end{array}\right]$$&#xA;Where $\delta$ is the target speed for either side.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When this system is stabilized, the robot will be upright, and will have each wheel rotating at a desired speed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the basic approach/outline.  I'll edit this with some more details tomorrow (and actual math, etc.), but I wanted to at least post the general idea now.

You may want to go and enroll in that class just to download that slide set... &lt;code&gt;:)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The hard part is computing the $A$ and $B$ matrices (it's a big linearization mess).

We can then say:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$\dot{\tilde x} = A(x - \delta) + Bu + A\delta$$&#xA;But, based on the solution for $A$ (from Coursera), $A\delta = 0$.  Thus:&#xA;$$\dot{\tilde x} = A\tilde x+ Bu$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now you can use pole placement to determine the correct eigenvalues, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="314" LastEditorUserId="314" LastEditDate="2013-03-13T02:25:06.047" LastActivityDate="2013-03-13T02:25:06.047" CommentCount="4" />

Often what is even more demanding on the components than extreme temperatures is temperature cycling.

Alternatively press start, right-click 'Computer', go to 'Manage' and check in Devices manager if you are showing up as a COM port. If you are not, then your problem lies with a) your driver (although your device should still show up) or on your embedded side. I'd bet on the latter. This means this is not the website for your to figure it out on and fixing this is no small task. However if you've come this far, maybe you won't mind coming a little further.

The &lt;code&gt;SerialPort&lt;/code&gt; class is widely regarding as being incredibly poorly written and the method &lt;code&gt;SerialPort.Open()&lt;/code&gt; actually performs about 8 things and if a single one of them fails then the whole method fails and you are up the creek. What I would do is download something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Termite&lt;/a&gt; and see if you can connect to the device that way. Most terminal programs ignore &lt;code&gt;IO Exceptions&lt;/code&gt; (which is what I bet is happening in your VB program). By the way, did you write the VB program yourself? If so, do you have a &lt;code&gt;try-catch&lt;/code&gt; around your &lt;code&gt;SerialPort.Open()&lt;/code&gt; method? Because that is a good way to figure out if that is where your problem lies.

Moreover, it is a statically stable gait, meaning that if you lock the joints with 3 legs down and turn the power off, the robot will not topple. This implies that you don't need to dynamically balance the robot while walking. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason when a legged robot falls down is that its center of gravity does not fall on its support polygon (in tripod gait case, it is a triangle with each corner on one leg that's touching the ground). So what you should do is to measure the center of gravity and guarantee that it never leaves the support polygon of your robot while walking via adjusting your leg motion. Of course, this is all for a statically stable gait. Dynamically stable gaits allow the center of gravity to leave the support polygon in a controlled manner. But as I said, the tripod gait is statically stable. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm assuming that you are using naked DC motors without encoders or gear trains. There are two issues about this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;First, make sure that you are getting enough total torque at each leg triplet that lift the robot. It may be the case that the DC motors cannot lift the robot on their own without a gear train. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Second, errors tend to grow without bound when performing such a task, angular position errors being one example. This is simply due to noise and imperfect modeling of the motor. So in a sense, DC motors are not actually &quot;controlled&quot;, you just apply an input while not knowing what the output is. You must apply closed loop control, which is done via getting feedback from an encoder. Then, you can sense what the angular position on your motor is, determine your error, and apply an input to correct that error.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both of these problems are addressed in a servomotor, which is basically a DC motor, a gear train to increase torque and reduce angular velocity, and an encoder. I very much suggest using servos for your leg joints. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1000" LastEditorUserId="1000" LastEditDate="2013-03-14T20:24:46.920" LastActivityDate="2013-03-14T20:24:46.920" CommentCount="2" />

In this case, if the position error is zero and the servo is at rest, then each of P, I and D components are zero, which means the exerted torque is zero. This would cause the weight to sink, which is countered by the error in its position causing P,I components to increase. Wouldn't this situation cause the lifted weight to oscillate and balance at a constant position which is significantly different from the goal position?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are 2 different cases: the short-term state immediately after some heavy load is applied, and the long-term state after the arm is allowed to settle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please tell the person who told you that &quot;if the position error is zero and the servo is at rest, then the I component is zero&quot; to experiment with a PID controller, or read a little more about control systems (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/control_system&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ftcforum.usfirst.org/showthread.php?1359-Problem-holding-motor-in-fixed-position-for-jointed-arm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coactionos.com/embedded-design/39-motor-control.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seattlerobotics.org/encoder/200011/SmallRobotMotionControl.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://letsmakerobots.com/node/36435&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;), or both, to fill in the gaping hole in his knowledge of what the I component does in a PID controller.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PID with near-zero I component&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the short term, the P, I, and D components start out at approximately zero,&#xA;and so the exerted torque is approximately zero.&#xA;When Fred suddenly applies a heavy load, there is not enough torque to hold it in position, so it sinks.&#xA;The error in its position causes the P,I components to increase.&#xA;If, hypothetically, one had a controller where the I component was &lt;em&gt;completely ignored&lt;/em&gt;,&#xA;then the arm would settle at some constant position, as you mentioned.&#xA;The arm would stabilize at the position where the voltage supplied by the controller (proportional to P, the error in position) was exactly enough to hold up the weight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PID with significant I component&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;PID controller&lt;/a&gt; you mentioned, the I component increases as long as there is &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; error.&#xA;Eventually there would be enough I component accumulated that the controller would increase the voltage more than enough to hold up the weight, pushing the weight back up towards the zero-error point.&#xA;Whether the weight overshoots or not depends on how the PID controller is tuned, but as long as the P,I,D components are anywhere close to a reasonable value, the PID controller will eventually settle down to the state where:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the arm is stable at almost exactly the goal position (with practically zero error)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;therefore the P and D components are practically zero&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The I component is not zero -- it still has some large value that accumulated previously when the arm was below the desired position.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the control electronics (because the I component is not zero) drive the motor with some voltage&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the motor converts that voltage into some torque that holds the weight up at the goal position.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many robotic control systems are quick enough that they converge on this final state within a tenth of a second.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When Fred (that prankster!) yanks the weight off the arm,&#xA;even though the arm is already at the goal position,&#xA;the high accumulated I component causes the arm to pop up.&#xA;That small error causes the accumulated I component to bleed off,&#xA;and (hopefully soon) the arm returns to almost exactly the goal position (with practically zero error).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="187" LastActivityDate="2013-03-19T00:14:09.130" CommentCount="1" />

In some packages these devices support up to 500 mA/channel when properly heatsinked; other packages allow less but should have no problem with the 85 mA start current and 75 mA run current of the vibration motor (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cutedigi.com/robotics/vibration-motor.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cutedigi.com/pub/Robot/310-101_datasheet.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An alternative is to substitute LED drivers with higher drive capability in place of the TLC5947. For example, the 16-channel &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.toshiba-components.com/products/DriverLSI/LEDDrivers.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Toshiba TC62D722&lt;/a&gt; allows up to 90mA/channel.  (I don't know what the availability of these parts is.)  Like the TI  TLC5947, the TC62D722 has per-channel PWM settings.  Both parts use an external current-limit-setting resistor and the TC62D722 also has an 8-bit (256 level) output current gain control.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that TLC5947 channels can be paralleled.  On page 7 the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/sbvs114a/sbvs114a.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;data sheet&lt;/a&gt; says multiple outputs can be tied together to increase the constant current capability.  Thus you could use each TLC5947 to drive eight 90mA devices; or could use a 25mA-setting resistor and parallel 3 outputs to get 75mA.  Anyhow, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; TLC5947's, daisy-chained together, would drive &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;·24/3 = 8·&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; vibration motors.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have motors on hand, you could use a 12V power supply in series with a 166 ohm resistor (or 150 or 200 ohms for other testing) to run about 60mA through a motor and see if it starts and runs satisfactorily.  If so, you might be able to use two TLC5947 channels instead of three per motor.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Drivers like ULN2003 or ULN2803 have internal clamp diodes so they can drive inductive loads without needing such diodes added on.  As an LED driver, the TLC5947 doesn't include clamp diodes for high-going voltage excursions since LED's are not much of an inductive load.  (The output diagram on page 8 of specs shows a diode from ground to OUT_n for OUT0 through OUT23, which would clamp negative-going voltages, but no rating is shown for the diode.)  You probably would need to add one clamp diode per motor.  However, it certainly is possible that you could run motor tests and find that the motor transients don't exceed the 33 volt output ratings of the TLC5947 – whenever you test it on the bench.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="478" LastEditorUserId="478" LastEditDate="2013-04-02T08:04:12.563" LastActivityDate="2013-04-02T08:04:12.563" CommentCount="1" />

Today &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/design-tools.html&quot;&gt;Xilinx&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.altera.com/literature/po/ss_quartussevswe.pdf&quot;&gt;Altera&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latticesemi.com/products/designsoftware/diamond/downloads.cfm&quot;&gt;Lattice&lt;/a&gt; all have freely available development environments that run on Windows and Linux with 32 and 64-bit support. If you insist on open source &lt;a href=&quot;http://iverilog.icarus.com/&quot;&gt;Icarus Verilog&lt;/a&gt; can do quite a bit. But I'd personally stick with the vendor specific tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;FPGA's are more than just a bunch of configurable flip flops. Consider the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alterawiki.com/wiki/Nios&quot;&gt;Altera NIOS II&lt;/a&gt;. A 32-bit soft-core processor capable of running Linux. Mix and match communications and other peripherals from &lt;a href=&quot;http://opencores.org/projects&quot;&gt;OpenCores&lt;/a&gt; or from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xilinx.com/products/intellectual-property/index.htm&quot;&gt;Xilinx&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.altera.com/products/ip/ip-index.jsp&quot;&gt;Altera&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latticesemi.com/products/intellectualproperty/index.cfm?source=topnav&quot;&gt;Lattice&lt;/a&gt; and you've built a custom microcontroller with everything you need and nothing you don't. You can even write C code for the NIOS II processor and have certain functions &lt;a href=&quot;http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/63690/from-c-to-silicon-how-to-implement-software-firmware-solution-as-hardware/63704#63704&quot;&gt;implemented directly in the FPGA hardware&lt;/a&gt; if you need the speed. Is that high level enough thinking for you?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;FPGA's have a high initial investment cost. But it's cheaper and easier to add functionality later in the design process. That's what's meant by &quot;forward looking&quot; designs. Consider a project where you want to add some additional motors to your robot but you've run out of PWM generators on your microcontroller. What do you do? Add another microcontroller? Buy separate PWM chips and connect them to a communications interface? What if all your communications interfaces are in use? With an FPGA, this is reduced almost entirely to a copy and paste operation. It's a lot easier, cheaper, and quicker to scale a design to include new functionality without buying as much additional hardware with an FPGA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But probably the biggest reason to use an FPGA is speed. I'm not talking about pure clock speed. But when you need a lot of things to happen simultaneously. As Gossamer mentioned, parallelism is what FPGA's are really good at. Filter designs especially benefit from this kind of parallel architecture. If you need to filter and respond to a rapidly changing sensor, then you need an FPGA. They are also quite good at video processing as this too benefits from parallel processing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Take for instance &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.virtualworldlets.net/Resources/Hosted/Resource.php?Name=HighSpeedRobotDexterity&quot;&gt;this high-speed hand robot&lt;/a&gt;. It needs to process the video from the high-speed (1000 frames per second) machine vision camera as well as the tactile sensors and respond by manipulating numerous actuators in only a few milliseconds. This type of project is when you &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to choose FPGAs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/K491N.png&quot; alt=&quot;massively parallel vision processing&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="142" LastActivityDate="2013-04-03T13:05:08.557" CommentCount="10" />

The equasion I came up with is this :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;xRate = (abs(currentX - nextX) / max(abs(currentX - nextX), abs(currentY - nextY))&#xA;yRate = (abs(currentY - nextY) / max(abs(currentX - nextX), abs(currentY - nextY))&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So basically, XRate: distance in x / max between distance in X and distance in Y.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, for the actual problem.  Because this limits the speed in both X and Y, the end-effector can travel (for instance) 1 in./sec in both directions at the same time.  Meaning that it is travelling at OVER 1 in./sec overall.  If, however, it is only moving in ONE direction then it will only move at that 1 in./sec speed because there is no second component.  It boils down to the fact that the max speed the arm can move is 'sqrt(2)' and the minimum is '1'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My main question is&lt;/strong&gt;:  Given that I need to calculate a max xRate and a max yRate, how can I limit the overall speed of the end-effector?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Secondarily, is there a way for me to implement a rate control that will limit the overall rate instead of limiting X and Y independantly using Simulink?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="852" LastActivityDate="2013-04-03T19:53:07.270" Title="Equation to limit rate of change of end-effector in X and Y coordinates" Tags="&lt;design&gt;" AnswerCount="1" />

But unfortunately not easy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is quite some heavy development going on now, since it seems to be the next promis of wind energy. This is because at higher altitudes, winds are stronger and more constant. In addition to that, there is no need for large constructions (like conventional wind turbines) and the setup is highly mobile (which indeed makes it ideal for emergency situations or developing countries). Lastly, there is less &quot;view pollution&quot; as we more or less call it in Dutch. This is the concept that everyone wants to use green wind energy in their homes, but no one wants a humongous wind turbine in their backyard because of the noise and the view. A kite however, can be a thousand square meters, but if its 5 kilometers up in the air, you just see a string going up in the air.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next to the advantages, there are some severe challenges as well though. These are of course in some hardware related parts. For example; how do you reliably track the kite in the air (which was exactly my issue with my other question), but also; how do you measure wind speed at kite height without the kite its wind disturbance, and how do you overcome the rope weight when the rope becomes 5 kilometers long?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The software issues seem to be a way bigger issue than the hardware ones though. It appears to be not so easy to fly a kite reliably in a figure 8. This is because you're dealing with quite an unstable environment; changing wind direction, varying speed, and incidental wind gusts. Kite deformations and the different reactions of the kite in different parts within and outside the so called &quot;wind power zone&quot; are very different. A simple PID controller is not the easy solution apparantly. In addition to these things, heavy wind gusts can also be a danger in that it can break the kite's rope. So the kite must be able to quickly depower itself when a windgust comes up, which needs some kind of feed-forward loop. Finally, if the wireless data connection between the kite and the ground station breaks (for whatever reason) how can the kite control itself to decent to make a safe landing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason I'm so into this is because I'm looking into doing a PhD at the Delft University to develop a evolutionary based self learning kite control system for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://kitepower.eu/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;currect kitepower project&lt;/a&gt; they have there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although I'm not very experienced with the hardware side of the story, I thought why not start myself while I haven't started at the TU Delft yet?

I am now able to do some motor controlling and I am currently in the process of collecting some parts I need.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you also want to try building one that would be great.

And robotics is a great application area for custom microprocessors -- perhaps a vision cortex with many parallel decision pathways handled directly in hardware, or special tensor multiplication in hardware -- basically anything that generic processors can't handle well off-the-shelf.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But if you're going to microprocessor designs in FPGAs, well, then of course you'll need to have all of that low level knowledge you mention, and more -- because fundamentally you'll be designing your own processor.  Which has nothing really to do with robotics, even though your target application might be robotics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most designers can probably find an existing processor that will do most of what they'll ever need.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I think you probably &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; need an FPGA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A starter roadmap: from commercial capabilities to (maybe) an FPGA...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First goal in my opinion is to try to get all of your creative concepts built up into a working robot (quite an intensive challenge in itself).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you find that you've got specific and significant processing bottlenecks in your design, then the next goal is optimising the selection / design of your processors, still commercially available chips.  Maybe bigger, faster (trade-off with power draw, heat dissipation).  Maybe smaller, dedicated chips handling specific tasks and interfacing with the main brain (trade-off with algorithm / logic complications).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Only if there's capabilities that you just won't be able to get commercial chips to handle, then you might consider implementing a specialised processor inside an FPGA because at that point there will be very clear advantages that you hope to gain by 'rolling your own', and you can focus on just implementing those capabilities, with the right interfaces to rest of your design.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, you're likely to get side-tracked from your main goal (which I'm going to assume is to actually build a robot!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom line: FPGAs are a distraction from getting started in robotics --- until you're quite a ways down the robotics road -- and have gained some strong chops in digital electronics / microprocessor design somewhere along the way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1013" LastEditorUserId="1013" LastEditDate="2013-04-07T09:46:04.990" LastActivityDate="2013-04-07T09:46:04.990" CommentCount="2" />

There is absolutely no other way unless you buy the micro, code it and run tests.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So first, you need to define what exactly processing means. Best way to do it is to write the program that does the processing, in assembly. Let's take a hypothetical program in a hypothetical assembly:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;load R1, portA&#xA;add R1, R1, 1&#xA;store portB, R1&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First thing you need to know is how many cycles it takes the microcontroller to execute this code. Again, you need to consult the data sheet of the micro. Hypothetical numbers:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Load takes 3 cycles&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Load from PortA adds 2 cycles overhead&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Add takes 1 cycle&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Store takes 2 cycles&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Store to PortB adds 4 cycles overhead&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So you would know that for each piece of data you read (hypothetically, 1 byte) you need 12 cycles to process them, assuming the micro is stupid enough to not use pipelines, prefetching of any sort etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you read the specifications well, you will know get a good estimate of the speed of the micro for your task. In our hypothetical example, 1 byte per 12 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So to address your first question, how to know if the micro is good enough for your task, it's quite simple. You want &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; bytes of data per second so it takes &lt;code&gt;12X&lt;/code&gt; cycles to do that. All you need to know is how many cycles per second the micro runs (let's say &lt;code&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt;). So if &lt;code&gt;Y &amp;gt; 12X&lt;/code&gt; you're good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your second question is also simple to answer. You already have the speed in terms of &quot;per cycle&quot;. To calculate the speed in terms of &quot;per second&quot;, you just multiply the per-cycle speed by cycles/second of the microcontroller (again, found in the data sheet). In our hypothetical example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;speed (byte/cycle) = 1/12&#xA;speed (byte/second) = 1/12 * Y&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you define your task, so it would be clear how heavy the computation is, probably higher grade students or even vendors would be able to help you pick up a suitable micro.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="158" LastEditorUserId="158" LastEditDate="2013-04-08T16:12:41.950" LastActivityDate="2013-04-08T16:12:41.950" />

Suppose $z$ is just a position measurement. We'd like to update $o_1$ &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; $o_2$'s estimated position, but we have no idea with object we just measured.

If the measurement doesn't &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; to match any known estimates, you might have just detected a new object.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, I have a suspicion that your question will be heavily edited, so I'm not putting a lot of details in just now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;To address your newer, revised question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You have a different problem, but it is totally related. First, you want to fuse objects. This is as simple as estimating the probability that all measurements of object 1 and all measurements of object 2 are in fact of the same object.  The algorithm is simple, but nearly intractable computationally. This is the same as track merger.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To really do this with objects in 3D, you need a model of the object which allows you to estimate the probability that two partially overlapping (or possibly just nearby) objects are in fact the same object). But this is exactly the same as the acceptance gate approach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;note&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are only a few really useful ways to mere measurements, and they are well defined. I strongly suggest if you wish to continue with abstract tracking and estimation tasks that you read Bar-Shalom's &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/047141655X&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tracking and Estimation book&lt;/a&gt;.

The distinction seems quite well grounded, although Wikipedia does a poor job of making it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;em&gt;embedded systems&lt;/em&gt; (ES) has been around since the 60s and can, arguably, refer to anything from an airplane to a Furby. I think the term &lt;em&gt;cyber-physical systems&lt;/em&gt; (CPS) was coined to distinguish it from what are traditionally thought of as embedded systems, namely closed-loop, non-networked &quot;boxes&quot; that operate in a very well-defined and constrained domain with a limited power to affect physical systems. CPS, on the other hand, embody the idea of &lt;em&gt;think globally, act locally&lt;/em&gt; (my apologies to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_Globally,_Act_Locally#Origin_in_town_planning&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Patrick Geddes&lt;/a&gt;), that is, they are usually highly networked systems that bring about change in a local physical system dependent on the state and actions of other entities in the wider network. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While many robotic applications fit this definition, and can therefore be termed cyber-physical systems, many are not. What bestows the honour on MIT's robotic garden, I believe, is the fact that the robots form &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.lirmm.fr/lirmm/interne/BIBLI/CDROM/ROB/2009/IROS_2009/papers/1119.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;part of a wider, decentralised system&lt;/a&gt; (PDF). It is the plants, equipped with sensors, that decide when to request watering or other services from the robots, while it is the robots that then decide between them which one will fulfil that request. Furthermore, not all CPS are thought of as &quot;robotic&quot;, for example, an intelligent power grid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cybernetics&lt;/a&gt;, as @Theran has noted, is occupied with the study of control systems, and so will form a core part of studying CPS, but also has a broader range of applications in fields such as mathematics, economics, and sociology, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2008/EECS-2008-8.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;report on cyber-physical systems&lt;/a&gt; (PDF), by Edward Lee from UC Berkeley, makes clear that CPS are a next step in the evolution of embedded systems with many of the same constraints (real-time capabilities, reliability) plus a few extra ones (robustness, adaptability, intelligence, interconnectedness). As such, the field of CPS is, in parts, concerned with developing completely new approaches to hard- and software architecture. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;But I believe that to realize its full potential, CPS systems will require fundamentally new technologies [...] One approach that is very much a bottom-up approach is to modify computer architectures to deliver precision timing [...] Complementing bottom-up approaches are top-down solutions that center on the concept of model-based design [...] In this approach, &quot;programs&quot; are replaced by &quot;models&quot; that represent system behaviors of interest. Software is synthesized from the models. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lee's thoughts are echoed in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jiafuwan.net/download/cyber_physical_systems.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Embedded Computing column&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) by Wayne Wolf of Georgia Tech.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;After all, we've had computers attached to stuff for a long time. Why, you may ask, do we need a new term to describe what we've been doing for years? [...] We have a surprisingly small amount of theory to tell us how to design computer-based control systems. Cyber-physical systems theory attempts to correct this deficiency. [...] Cyber-physical systems actively engage with the real world in real time and expend real energy. This requires a new understanding of computing as a physical act—a big change for computing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recommend reading both articles for a good view on how CPS are different from &quot;mere&quot; embedded systems. &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyberphysicalsystems.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cyberphysicalsystems.org&lt;/a&gt; has a concept map of CPS on their homepage that nicely illustrates many of the aspects involved in developing CPS. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the origin of the term, none of the sources I found attributed it to anyone. Many papers defined it without attribution while clearly not being the first to use them. The term first crops up in the literature in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22cyber-physical+systems%22&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;amp;as_ylo=&amp;amp;as_yhi=2006&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt; but, by that time, the US National Science Foundation had already organised a &lt;a href=&quot;http://varma.ece.cmu.edu/cps/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Workshop on Cyber-Physical Systems&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that the term was already in use by then.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="131" LastEditorUserId="37" LastEditDate="2013-04-10T14:20:40.053" LastActivityDate="2013-04-10T14:20:40.053" />

Your device may be slower, bulkier, noisier, less reliable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One possible approach is to use dot matrix printer print-heads to drive pins.  See example of pins being driven in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/12648709&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;vimeo.com&lt;/a&gt; video called  “Dot Matrix Print Head - Testing”.  You might need to replace the pins with push wires so that you could go from a 3-by-9 pin layout to a 4-by-4 or 4-by-5 arrangement.  Some fairly old (and bulky) print-heads already contain push wires.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the print-head pins are driven ballistically they might not be able to work with the high duty cycle that a Braille dot would require.  If you use push wires, you could have a cam that moves a latch plate back and forth, alternately latching wires in place or releasing them so they can move up or down.  Or you could have a cam that lifts all the  Braille pins at once, and a print head that drives some latch pins sideways to catch those Braille pins that that should remain up.  Another cam would clear all the latch pins at the beginning of each character cycle. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are miniature solenoids as shown below with roughly 1cm square cross-section, with a 1.5mm diameter pin that moves about 3mm.  (Listed on ebay as “Miniature Electric Solenoid - 9 V - Push Type - 2 oz. Force - 3 mm Stoke”, about \$7.)  The duty cycle of this solenoid is 10%, so like a ballistic print head it would require some latch mechanism, as well as a spring or gravity return.  You would need to attach push wires to the end of the shaft because the solenoids won't cluster closely enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/VvxM2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Miniature Electric Solenoid - 9 V - Push Type&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="478" LastActivityDate="2013-04-18T23:18:49.453" />

Similar to this would be an IR distance sensor, which records the distance from the sensor to an object by way of the angle of the light reflections. The problem with any sort of sensor based around light (such as IR) is that it can be &quot;corrupted&quot; easily by ambient light: the sun, light bulbs, camera flash, etc. The way to get around this is to pulse the light, only looking for light of a specific frequency (this is how IR TV remotes work). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Example sensors: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.acroname.com/robotics/info/articles/sharp/sharp.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.acroname.com/robotics/info/articles/sharp/sharp.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are also things such as ultrasonic rangefinders which use sound instead of light:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.acroname.com/robotics/parts/R335-SRF06.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.acroname.com/robotics/parts/R335-SRF06.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the most complicated level, you could have a camera mounted that detects when a rock has been moved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you could use a physical sensor to tell when a rock has been moved.

So additional to &quot;not having cables strong enough&quot; and &quot;the slow speed&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cable wear: The cable used for the elevator will be partially below the clouds (subject to &lt;strong&gt;warmth&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;dry air&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;rain&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;snow&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;wind&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;tornadoes&lt;/strong&gt; etc), partially in and above clouds (&lt;strong&gt;Humid&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Cold&lt;/strong&gt;), partially in vacuum (&lt;strong&gt;extreme cold&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;no air pressure&lt;/strong&gt;), sometimes in the sun (&lt;strong&gt;extremely hot&lt;/strong&gt; outside atmosphere), sometimes in the shade (&lt;strong&gt;near 0 degrees&lt;/strong&gt; outside atmosphere) etc. So any cable used for the elevator should be able to resist &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; these environments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The situation is made worse by considering the &lt;strong&gt;friction&lt;/strong&gt; between the &quot;wheels&quot; of the elevator and the track, &lt;strong&gt;chemical reactions&lt;/strong&gt; with the environment, &lt;strong&gt;radiation&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;solar flares&lt;/strong&gt; and even &lt;strong&gt;biological&lt;/strong&gt; reasons (for example an eagle deciding he doesn't like the cable, or a sort of moss evolving to take advantage (aka eat) the material)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cable repair: Sooner or later, the cable needs repair. There is no such thing as &quot;indestructible&quot;. Now imagine, how would you repair such a long cable? Surely, you can't just cut the bad parts and patch it, because the &quot;welded&quot; parts would probably not be strong enough. Replacing the whole cable would be an option which is quite expensive, given the special tough material and the long length. So, at least this issue would delay building the space elevator until they are sure it's doable.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Safety of the elevator: One challenge is to be able to provide safety for the elevator. For example, how would you prevent asteroids from damaging it?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Safety of the passengers: Another challenge is to provide safety for the passengers. With a slow speed, passing through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belts&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Allen radiation belts&lt;/a&gt; is not healthy. This means that there should be adequate radiation shielding on the elevator, adding weight to it and making it harder to build.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Safety of others: Yet another issue is providing safety for others, such as airplanes or space satellites.

Actually you would divide torque by moment of inertia to get your angular acceleration, &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So you can simplify by giving your drone two static properties:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; thrust as max acceleration&#xA; and torque as max angular acceleration&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;instead of giving it four properties&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Force and mass&#xA;and Torque and MoI.&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And now crunch the numbers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now you have your drone's Position: Px, Py, S -- it's first derivative, velocity: Vx, Vy, W -- and it's second derivative, acceleration: Ax, Ay, U&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Actually Ax, Ay will be calculated from S (angular position) and T (acceleration) by:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ax = T ×  cos(S)&#xA;Ay = T × -sin(S)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That should get you a good way towards generating your formulas.

But the link my professor provided me with really helped me, it has decent animations to help understanding the concept. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Okay so here's my understanding of the mechanism. &#xA;The differential system essentially could consist of either of these two mechanisms:&#xA;The Differential Gearbox and the Differential Bar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The differential Gearbox consists of three gears. The one in the middle (2) is connected to the body, while the ones on the side (1) rockers of the system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/sZMdI.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you were to pick the rocker bogie up and hold the body intact, and tilt one of the side rocker downwards, the gears in the gearbox would make the rocker on the other side tilt upward. If you tilt it upwards, the other one would tilt it downwards. More complex system use more gears to make the whole system more sensitive to the movements.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the Differential bar, it's not used on the rover as it interferes with the solar panel, but it works in a similar way. Except its rod that connects the two rockers. And this rod is pivoted in the middle onto the body. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, as far as my understanding goes, look at the picture and consider the gears on either side (Gears numbered 1). If one of the gear(let's say the top one) is turning clockwise, it would make Gear no. 2 (which sits in the grove of both of the other gears.) move anti-clockwise. Which in turn would make the other No.1 Gear turn anti-clock wise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; ALL THE GEARS FIT INTO THE GROOVE OF EACH OTHER. So any rotation that takes place in this system affects the other two gears. And the gears are attached or arranged in such a way that No.1's are running in the opposite direction of each other. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/icHbj.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Here's the differential Bar on Curiosity&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here you can see the differential Bar on Curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1213" LastEditorUserId="1106" LastEditDate="2013-10-01T21:52:42.430" LastActivityDate="2013-10-01T21:52:42.430" CommentCount="7" />

The issue of limited resolution (where the delivered amount is an integer multiple of cup size) can be treated by using a smaller cup, or using different cups for different jobs, or using a box with an adjustable side or bottom, or having the box sit on a load cell during filling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="478" LastActivityDate="2013-05-04T15:25:08.137" CommentCount="1" />

What this acceleorometer does is calculates the rate of rotation based on G-forces around a given radius.

The driver or user then uses this LED to decide using the remote control the direction he wants to traverse to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the moving, as mundane it might sound is done by switching the motor on and off. &#xA;The program or the control of the system turns a motor on when that motor is in the correct position to result in a net movement the direction the robot is indicated to go to.&#xA;So for example the LED is lit between 30 and 120 degrees it can be interpreted as the direction of the robot would be around 90 degrees.(Keep in mind that the indications of the heading using the LED is not a 100% accurate, the might be off by more than some tens of degrees. Usually because of the time taken for all the data processing and the time taken to switch the LED's on and off). If you wanted to move forward now, the motors would be needed to be on between 270 and 450(360+90) degrees during each rotation after which the net direction of travel will be 90 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Likewise if the robot wants to go to the left that is 180 degrees, but its current heading is 90.

Standard servos work by receiving a pulsed signal with a 20ms period (50Hz). Regular hobby servos will rotate to a specific angle based on the duty cycle (ON time) of the pulsed control signal. This on time can range from 500us to 2500us, but usually only a range of 1000us to 2000us is used so as to not damage the servo. The &quot;neutral pulse&quot; of 1500us will put the servo in the center position.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servo_control&quot;&gt;Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt; about servo control has a great picture regarding the pulsed control:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/j8bB5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Servo Pulses&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a few different ways that the servo works, but the most common type I've seen in use by hobbyists is an analog servo. As the motor turns, an internal potentiometer is adjusted creating a feedback path for the internal circuitry. The servo will continue to rotate until the potentiometer is at the expected position for the given pulse width.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;em&gt;numerous&lt;/em&gt; different ways of modifying a standard hobby servo for continuous rotation, so I won't go into that, but essentially, this feedback path is tampered with such the servo never thinks it is in the correct position when it gets a non &quot;neutral&quot; pulse. A mechanical stop on the internal gears is also removed. Once this is done, sending a non neutral pulse will cause the servo to rotate completely, with the speed of rotation dependent upon the pulse width.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Issue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When a non-modified servo is given a pulse, it will quickly rotate to the desired position and hold it as long as a pulse is being sent. It should be very difficult to manually turn the servo at this time, and doing so will cause the internal motor to hum as it draws excessive current trying to correct itself during this overload situation. If the servo is disabled (receiving no pulse) it can be manually manipulated with ease.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A modified servo will exhibit similar behavior when under too much of a load - it will hum loudly and draw excessive current. While your servo may not be overloaded, it is obviously exhibiting similar symptoms and is most likely defective. When being driven, manually turning the actuator or stopping it from turning in its desired direction/speed is not a good idea, so keep that in mind for your other servos.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the defective servo tries to rotate, it is drawing so much current that the second servo cannot operate. That is why it worked fine once the defective servo was removed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1197" LastActivityDate="2013-05-18T07:35:30.943" CommentCount="1" />

The first component of the state increases a bit, contrary to what K(1:1:2) indicates - the third component of the innovation causes this, but currently I can not visualize this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First improvement would be to visualize how the third component of the innovation affects the state.

This can supply the motors and other actuators directly. Because electronics normally run at 5V or 3V, a voltage regulator is often used to decrease the voltage (it taps into the 12V supply, and outputs a regulated 5V for the electronics). This is good, because the current motors draw can change quickly and may sometimes affect the power supply. In this case, if the voltage regulator is insufficient, capacitors may be added across the 12V supply, but this is not often required.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In your case, supposing you don't want to use a voltage regulator, you should have separate battery cells supply your electronics (at 3V), and another stack of cells at 12V to run your motors. You can then connect the ground of each circuit to each other to provide a common reference for your motor control signals. This setup again prevents the motors from affecting the voltage supplied to your electronics (assuming they draw a relatively constant, low current, won't require voltage regulation, although you might add a few capacitors to help with this - especially when you have op-amps or other switching electronics). Also, each cell in each battery stack will have the same current drawn from it. This avoids the some batteries in a stack having more charge than others, or having more current drawn.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="145" LastActivityDate="2013-05-24T09:26:17.907" />

The no-load current of 250mA means that supplying 6V will cause the motor to draw 250mA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The half-bridge IC you have given has no current overload protection. Its peak current of 1.2A is high enough, but the 600mA continuous current is not. This can normally cause it to overheat, and possibly break. Under the absolute maximum ratings, it has a peak current of 1.2A for &amp;lt;100us. Normally, it may be possible to heat an IC a little more than recommended if a good heatsink is used. However, the &amp;lt;100us implies that this is not possible, because the heat would not be able to transmit through the package fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are your options:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can supply your own current foldback protection. By using a current sensor of some sort, you can detect when there is too much current flow, you can then scale down the voltage, possibly down to $6\times0.6\div1 = 3.6V$. Assuming a fast control circuit, this is probably fine (due to the peak current allowed).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can run the motor at only 3.6V. This limits the stall current, torque and maximum no-load speed, but means that you do not have to do any current foldback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can measure the speed of the motor, and assuming you know the back EMF constant of your motor, you can convert speed to back EMF voltage. This is the additional voltage that you can supply to your motor (in addition to the 3.6V which gives 0.6A of current). This is because the amount of the back EMF voltage represents the voltage which will cause zero current to flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that when you run the motor at 3.6V, this is just the average voltage.

There's no reason that it couldn't be as described below, except that there is precious little room inside of an RC servo, so there's a good chance that no current measurement is done, and hence that the parameter that the microprocessor controls is the PWM duty cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How servo mechanisms in industry are controlled is a much wider answer: basically, it can happen any way that the designer thought was appropriate.  Motor drive can be via a linear amplifier that is configured to drive a current or a voltage, or it can be via a switching amplifier (i.e. PWM).  In the case of a switching amplifier, the amplifier itself can be analog and configured for either constant-current, constant-voltage, or constant duty cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Usually in a &quot;pro&quot; servo mechanism with a brushed or brushless motor there will be an inner loop that servos the motor current (and therefor torque).

Utility function tells you what reward has the strongest reinforcement effect (biggest impact on behaviour) in a given context. Is it praise? chocolate? cocaine? direct electrical stimulation to certain areas of the brain? Mostly my answer is about effect of context, assuming a given reward utility.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For complex organisms/behaviours, reward scheduling is at least as important as reward utility:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A &quot;fixed-interval reward schedule&quot; is the least effective way to modify behaviour with a given quantity of reward (I'll give you \$10 per week if you keep your bedroom tidy). Think dole bludger.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fixed ratio reward schedules (I'll give you \$10 every seven days you have a tidy bedroom) are more effective than fixed intervals, but they have a kind of effectiveness ceiling (subject will tidy their room seven times when they are hungry for \$10, but not otherwise). Think mercenary.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The most influential way to deliver a given reward with a &quot;variable interval reinforcement schedule&quot; (e.g. every day you tidy your bedroom you have a 1/7 chance of getting $10). Think poker machine.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are a learning supervisor with a fixed reward budget, for a given learning situation, there will be an optimum balance of reward size (utility) and frequency. It's probably not a very small slice of reward at a very high frequency, nor a very large chunk of reward delivered very rarely. It might even be a random size reward at a random schedule - the optimum is usually determined experimentally for a particular situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the &quot;optimum&quot; schedule (random frequency, random quantity {p(reward),p(value)}) will probably vary at different stages in the learning process. For example, a new pupil might be subject to &quot;primacy&quot; effect (welcome! have a jelly bean) that quickly becomes fixed-interval reward if you repeat it. There might be a &quot;recency&quot; effect that gets more reinforcement value from a reward delivered on the very last trial (&quot;finishing on a high note&quot;). In between, there may be an accumulative &quot;faith effect&quot; where as a learner becomes more experienced, the optimum might shift toward lower probability, higher utility over time.

A quadrotor needs a balanced set of rotation directions so that it can easily control yaw direction, and at equilibrium, all propellers can rotate at the same speed. This is primarily because all rotors in a quadrotor are fixed (usually). The quadrotor can also control yaw by varying the speed of propellers that rotate in one direction versus another.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Propeller orientation does not matter so much when it has some other method to control yaw. For example, helicopters have a tail rotor, which corrects for any yaw moment caused by the main propeller. Thus, if it was to set to rotate in the opposite direction, the tail rotor can just rotate in the opposite direction to counter this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The standard tricopter has two front rotors, and a third rear rotor. However, the rear rotor can change its axis. It tilts left or right. When it tilts left or right, a portion of its thrust acts in the yaw direction. Therefore, where front rotors rotate in the same direction, the rear rotor must tilt more the counter the moment from the front rotors. Where the front rotors rotate in opposite directions, the rear rotor tilts less. This is explained in &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/22778782&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the video&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?s=768e670da2be9e8df7c955f722722400&amp;amp;p=24951580&amp;amp;postcount=4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;message #4&lt;/a&gt; of the link you posted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason why the controllers does not even need to know the direction of rotation in the tri-copter is because it is a feedback controller. Thus, when it senses undesired yaw, it simply tilts the rear rotor in the opposite direction to correct the yaw direction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that the rear rotor, when tilted in one direction, also causes a lateral force. This is counter-balanced by having the whole tricopter tilt in the opposite direction. Hence, the front rotors are tilted (to a lesser degree), and part of their force is oriented laterally.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, tricopters are more stable and performs better when the front rotors are counter-rotating, because the rear rotor can tilt less (as well as the whole tricopter tilting less).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summary, the general rule is that propeller orientation is a consideration &lt;strong&gt;unless&lt;/strong&gt; it has some other mechanism to correct for yaw. With more than 4 rotors (which are unable to tilt), it is not necessary to have rotors in one direction be exactly equal to the number in the other direction, because it can change the speed of the rotors independently to exactly cancel out the moments. However, this may cause uneven utilisation of the rotors - we tend to like symmetry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="145" LastEditorUserId="37" LastEditDate="2013-06-03T15:11:46.800" LastActivityDate="2013-06-03T15:11:46.800" />

One straight forward solution is to use a RC-Servo motor. An RC-Servo motor is a high torque (DC motor with gearbox) actuator which can be instructed to rotate at a specific angle. It is controlled through a PWM signal. So you need to figure out the duty cycle of the PWM signal to do the desired movement and push the button you want.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Secondly we need a controller that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;is able to generate a PWM signal&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;communicate through the Internet&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First thing that comes to my mind is to use a Raspberry Pi.

Every type of drive has its own privileges according these requirements, but you totally have an eye on costs and your control as well. For these kind of tasks i would suggest a pneumatic drive for example. But it could be a combination of different types as well, e.g. wrist - electrical drive, finger - pneumatics and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;What kind of control would i need to control these motions?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; For this you have to consider several aspects such as complexity, your chosen drive, energy consumption (mobile systems!!) and costs as well. Hardware would not be a problem since embedded systems nowadays are quite powerful and performant. But in your case your control would contain closed loops since you need a feedback on force to not destroy your touchpad and keyboard. Which is in general quite complex and difficult to solve in realtime.

We know that it is possible to send a beam of light at an object, and detect how long it takes to be reflected back to the sensor to measure its distance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First of all, we use lasers because reflection of the light from the object is so important. lasers keep the light concentrated in a narrow beam, with minimal refraction. We'll come back to that later.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are several ways to measure distance. The first is triangulation. This typically depends on good placement of optics, and the CCD sensor the return beam shines onto. You can easily see the problem with a large distance - the angle detected gets increasingly close to $0^\circ$, so that we need sensor components which are very accurate at small scales. We would also like a beam width which is narrow for accurate detection of where the beam is, but there is greater diffraction at narrow beam widths, meaning the return beam of light is not that narrow. Over long distances, the beam gets increasingly wider, because of the small amount of diffraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second way is to measure the round-trip time. Light travels very fast at $3\times 10^8  \textrm{m/s}$. This means that even detecting something at $150 \textrm{m}$ will take $1 \textrm{μs}$. Embedded computers typically have a clock rate of only several megahertz, so even at this large distance, a system would struggle to provide an accuracy of 10%, and that is assuming the data acquisition is as fast - often the peripheral features have a slower clock rate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The data acquisition is typically much slower, allowing cheaper systems to be built. As to how they can get away with this - an interesting phenomenon is used. If a sinusoidal signal is embedded into the light (via the intensity), the return signal will also be a sinusoidal signal. However, depending on the distance, the signal will have a phase shift. That is, at $0 \textrm m$, there is no phase shift, and if the wavelength is $20 \textrm m$, then an object at $5 \textrm m$ will mean that the light travels $10 \textrm m$, creating a phase shift of $180^\circ$. If the signals are normalized to the same amplitude, taking the difference between the outbound signal, and the return signal, we get another analog sinusoidal signal (note: this is only one method). The amplitude of this depends on the phase shift. At $180^\circ$, we get the maximum amplitude - double of the original outbound signal. We can easily detect the amplitude of this signal even with slow digital circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main problem is that the choice of wavelength limits the maximum range. For example, the wavelength of $20 \textrm m$ limits the detection range to only $5\textrm m$. If we simply chose a much longer wavelength, we would get the same percentage accuracy. In many cases, if we want greater absolute accuracy, the system will have a greater cost, since we must more accurately measure amplitude in the face of environmental noise. This may involve a number of changes - for example, a larger laser beam, greater light intensity, and more accurate electronic components, more shielding of noise, and more power to run the system. If any one of these is not good enough, accuracy is affected.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other problem which affects all methods is the intensity of the return beam. As the distance increases, the intensity decreases. There is not that much scatter of light in air, so attenuation is not so much caused by this. However, even though a laser light is used, there is a very small amount of diffraction. It is not possible to remove this diffraction completely, although it can be decreased with a wider beam width. Diffraction reduces the amount of the returning light beam incident on the sensor. Because the beam width gradually increases, the sensor only receives a small proportion of the returning light. This affects the accuracy of measurements. Using a larger sensor can also increase noise. Therefore, here we also see another limit on the distance. We can increase the distance by increasing light intensity, or increasing beam width. However, increasing light intensity increases power consumption and heat, while increasing beam width requires larger optic lenses, and larger distances between optic components.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, there is a balance between cost, accuracy, power consumption, and size of the system, and longer distances often requires better components to maintain accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="145" LastEditorUserId="145" LastEditDate="2013-06-14T23:16:17.137" LastActivityDate="2013-06-14T23:16:17.137" CommentCount="1" />

First, I don't know whether the Mavlink library will fit on the Uno though I believe it will. Second, it does require that your Uno query the APM by sending requests for data but they are simple enough to construct. The purpose for this is to control the flow of information. If I recall correctly you can instruct the device to repeatedly send the data you are interested in but you will have to review the documentation to confirm as much. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="177" LastActivityDate="2013-06-18T15:18:49.450" CommentCount="2" />

Then I would store a time vs. position trajectory that I wanted the motor to follow, which would result in my desired velocity trajectory.  Then I would servo the motors to the desired positions using PID control.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rule of thumb for control loops that generally works is to sample ten times faster than your desired bandwidth.  That works out to a sampling interval that's ten times shorter than the amount of time you want to allow for your system to settle &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; it is operating in its linear range (which roughly starts at the last instant that any of the variables come out of saturation).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your encoders are coarse enough that they don't go through many transitions in your desired control loop sampling interval, you may be better off sampling at the encoder transitions.

In that case the model would have to adjust for flipping the quadrotor upside down to increase the depth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rest of the model could be used as is: it's medium independent. In fact, the only portion of the model that touches on the medium is the equations for torque and thrust of the propellers:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$&#xA;K_T = \frac{T}{\rho n^2 D^4}&#xA;$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$&#xA;K_Q = \frac{Q}{\rho n^2 D^5}&#xA;$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In these equations, $K_T$ is a thrust constant, $K_Q$ is a torque constant, $T$ is thrust, $\rho$ is free stream density (air or water), $n$ is rotation speed, and $D$ is rotor diameter. To operate the model in water $\rho$ just has to be replaced with the density of water ($1000 kg/m^3$).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1524" LastEditorUserId="37" LastEditDate="2013-06-24T17:41:31.707" LastActivityDate="2013-06-24T17:41:31.707" />

Here's some general bits-o-answer: some assembly is required.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, I would leave the decision about stepper vs. some other kind of motor until later -- it should be a tactical, not a strategic, decision.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, assuming that the positive displacement idea works at all, I would assume that at the core of your machine you still need that piston that you mention.  I would achieve controlled displacement of the piston by using some sort of linear actuator that has lots of available force and considerable mechanical stiffness, coupled with a good distance measurement on the piston.  I'd close my outer loop around the distance that the piston has traveled.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What springs to mind for a linear actuator is either a stepper motor (probably geared down) driving a jack screw, or a small DC gear motor, with an encoder on the motor and speed control, driving a jack screw.  I am personally biased against steppers, so if I were King on this project it would almost certainly be the DC gear motor -- but if you were paying me to implement it with a stepper, I'd say &quot;sure!&quot; and make sure that you selected one that had more than sufficient torque to get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The field is pretty open as far as the piston position sensor.  I don't know how clean your environment is, but assuming reasonable cleanliness I'd probably choose an optical linear encoder with a good fine line -- but I know there's other technologies out there that would work as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For control I'd close the piston, fill the piston by some extra amount to account for bubbles or whatever, switch the flow over to the bottle, then push the piston in by the correct distance to get the amount of fill desired.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or, I'd find a way to weigh the bottles as I was filling them, and do the job by weight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1533" LastActivityDate="2013-06-28T16:51:14.833" CommentCount="1" />

Likewise, a DC/DC buck converter (that converts high voltages to lower voltages, at ~ 95% efficiency) doesn't help.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 20A, 10Ah parameters of your SOCl2 example imply 30 minutes of operation.  The 20A, 14.4V parameters imply energy rate is 288 W.  The current drain per cell in the example is 1A (which exceeds the rating of a typical AA  SOCl2 cell).  If we limit per-cell current to 1A, we get 3.6 W per cell.  Then the number of cells required is 288/3.6 = 80 cells, regardless of the cells' series or parallel configuration, which is why a higher voltage to the motor controller, or to a buck converter, doesn't help.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="478" LastActivityDate="2013-06-29T20:29:40.677" CommentCount="1" />

You will always want the line to be in the same position with respect to the robot, for instance in the centre of your sensor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if your line sensor outputs a value from -1 to 1 with 0 being the centre of the sensor, then you will want your set point to be zero (and sensor read back and difference will be the same). If your line sensor outputs a value of 0 to 10, then you will want your set point to be 5 (and your sensor read back and difference will be different).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since you are steering by setting the wheels to turn at different speeds, then to smoothly follow a line at a constant velocity, you will probably want to adjust the speeds for both wheels based on the error. For example, if you need to turn left to stay on the line, you will slow down the left wheel and speed up the right wheel. The more you need to turn, the more you will need to slow down the inside wheel and the more you will need to speed up the outside wheel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider the situation where you need to turn $\theta$ radians to the left to correct for error $e$ and your current speed is $S_0$:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3aDifferentialSteering.svg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/TVXKL.png&quot; alt=&quot;Differential Steering&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So your left wheel needs to travel at $S_L = r\theta$ and your right wheel needs to travel at $S_R = (r+b)\theta$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To maintain the same overall speed $S_0$, you need $S_0 = (r+b/2)\theta$, &#xA;so the left wheel will need to travel at $S_L = S_0 - (b/2)\theta$&#xA;while the right wheel will need to travel at $S_R = S_0 + (b/2)\theta$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As your error tends towards zero, the speeds of each motor will also tend towards each other. As the error grows, the speed differentials will grow too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may even need your inside wheel to rotate backwards if your sensor is telling you that the line is curving more tightly than the distance between your wheels. These are complications which you can work through step by step as your control gets more sophisticated though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, since your error will have both positive and negative values (to represent the continuum from &lt;em&gt;off the scale left ... too far left ... on the line ... too far right ... off the scale right&lt;/em&gt; then you should never need to ask &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; the error is positive or negative, you should just calculate new values based on the error value, since a positive value and a negative value should have opposite and symmetric effects on the motors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that for line following, you may be able to get away with just the proportional gain term (i.e. leaving the other terms at zero). Implementing a Derivative term may well allow you to push up the proportional gain term higher to get a more responsive system, but an integral term is unlikely to help. The fact that if you robot goes in the wrong direction the error will get larger means that your robots physical movements will act like an integral term anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The specific values of P, D and I will be determined by the responsiveness of your system.

To do that you need some way of measuring the speed.

I think the problem is we have a lot of control theory that is somewhat inaccessible (and sometimes not useful) and then we have rules of thumb that make assumptions about systems that are often inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's talk first about why control loops become unstable.  For this discussion I'll assume a linear system.  Informally this means that if your control signal is a sine wave at a given frequency then your observed output is at the same frequency and if you change the amplitude of your control system your output responds at the same ratio.  This assumption is a good approximation for many real world systems and lets us look at different frequencies in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you look at the control path you have a set-point, your PID controller, your system (aka &quot;Plant&quot;), and then your sensor.  Imagine a fixed set-point and a sine wave from your sensor (this is equal to a real world disturbance at the sensor, fed back).  In an unstable system your feedback causes the control loop to amplify the error rather than reducing it such that as time increases your amplitude increases.  The reason this happens is due do a delay, or for this particular frequency a phase shift between the input and output.  For a given frequency we can look at that open loop (i.e. no feedback) shift and amplitude of the output and when we draw all those on a graph we get something like a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bode_plot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bode Plot&lt;/a&gt;.  If we have a situation in this open loop graph where the error keeps getting amplified then we have an unstable system.  If the delay is less than 1/2 the wavelength or the gain is less than x1 the system will be &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barkhausen_stability_criterion&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;stable&lt;/a&gt;.  In practice we want some margin from that point (gain margin and phase margin) which is why you'll see this &quot;backing off&quot; in many of the manual/heuristic methods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main problem with those manual methods is that you're flying blind and you're pretty much guaranteed to get a poor control system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also keep in mind that the meaning P, I and D is related to what your sensor is measuring and what control you're applying.  A common mistake in home built controllers is for people to think they're applying P when they're actually not.  Motor controllers often have a position loop, running over a velocity loop running over a torque loop. (A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.controldesign.com/Media/0704/article_061_fig2-2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cascade&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OK but how does this help us?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first point I'd like to make is that if you're building your own PID controller you should also build a way of measuring the open loop response.  Do a frequency sweep at the input to your controller and measure the sensor's output with the feedback disconnected.  Then you can draw the open loop Bode plot and &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; why your system is stable and be able to trade off the various controls.  It's also useful to measure the closed loop response and you can do that with any system by doing a frequency sweep of your set-point while the loop is closed.  Both these aren't that hard and don't require a lot of theoretical knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're simply tweaking controls without any understanding of what's going on under the hood you won't be able to optimize your system.  Building some intuition about these systems isn't that hard.  E.g. the proportional gain has no effect on phase but simply increases the open loop gain across all frequencies.  So what you're doing when you're increasing the proportional gain in all those manual tuning methods is finding the frequency where the phase goes to -180.  See &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Control_Systems/Bode_Plots#Examples&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; to get some more idea about the impact of the various controls on your frequency response.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quite often getting best closed loop performance involves tweaking the system and not just the controller gains.  What you want is to make the system as &quot;stiff&quot; as possible.  That will let you ramp up the control parameters and get the best open and closed loop bandwidth.  In my experience in motor control applications the proportional gain is the one that should be doing most of the &quot;work&quot; and the integrator the &quot;rest&quot;.  I don't think you need a D term at all.  Having a low pass filter and a notch filter helps a lot in situations where you may have some mechanical resonance but setting them without a Bode Plot is very difficult (the oscillation frequency you observe under closed loop may be different than the open loop one).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If safety is a concern (very powerful motors or a system that could be destroyed by the motor going out of control) you need to put in some limits before you start tuning (e.g. current limit, maximum position error) to protect the system.  Then you need to get some sort of feel for the range of the parameters.  If your feedback has 40 counts per rotation or 4000 counts per rotation your parameters will be a factor of 100 for a given system.  My approach would be to first find a range where you have some poor controllability and then ramp up from there starting with P and then I (though again you're flying blind).  Backing off creates this stability margin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond closed loop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Closed loop attempts to take out the error from the system.  It's always going to have a somewhat limited performance.  What you want to do is minimize the error your closed loop controller sees and one way to do that is through a technique called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed_forward_%28control%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;feed forward&lt;/a&gt;.  In feed-forward you go around the controller and drive a command directly to the system.  An example of that would be acceleration feed-forward.  If you know you're motor's torque constant and you know the load you can pretty much tell how much current you need to drive to get a certain acceleration of the load.  You simply take the command input acceleration, multiply it by a constant and add that to the controller's drive command.  You're basically doing what it would take to drive the system if there was no controller and the closer you can get the less error your loop has to take out and the better your system will perform.  It makes a huge difference in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1584" LastActivityDate="2013-07-05T19:52:50.117" CommentCount="3" />

To do that, you need to balance all the forces: thrust from the propellers vs. gravity, and the torques of each motor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each motor produces both thrust and torque according to the equations:&#xA;$$&#xA;T = K_T\rho n^2 D^4&#xA;$$&#xA;$$&#xA;Q = K_Q\rho n^2 D^5&#xA;$$&#xA;Where $T$ is thrust, $Q$ is torque, $K_T$ and $K_Q$ are system dependent constants, $\rho$ is the air density, $n$ is rotor speed, and $D$ is rotor diameter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you increase thrust then you increase torque, and vice versa. A quadrotor remains stationary by balancing all the forces. This is possible because the quadrotor is symmetrical: two motors spin clockwise, and two motors spin anti clockwise. If all the motors rotate at the same speed then the torques balance, and the thrust balances. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only question then is what speed? The four rotors need to spin fast enough to collectively generate enough lift to remain in a stationary hover.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What about a trirotor?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Intuitively, the easy base case is when the arms holding the motors are all the same length (such that you can ignore the effects of the motor's displacement from the center of mass). In this case you must set the force of each motor to be equal (to hover without falling) then the torques will be unbalanced (2 in one direction, 1 in the other). The result is a spinning trirotor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The slightly more difficult case is when the rotor arms are not the same length. To solve that, let's solve the general case. The equation for torque is:&#xA;$$&#xA;\tau = rFsin(\theta)&#xA;$$&#xA;$sin(\theta)$ is 1 (at a right angle), so we can ignore it and rearrange our torque equation as follows:&#xA;$$&#xA;F = \frac{\tau}{r}&#xA;$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's make a trirotor and label it as follows:&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/bfK3P.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, we can balance all the torques:&#xA;$$&#xA;\frac{\tau_A}{r_A} + \frac{\tau_B}{r_B} + \frac{\tau_C}{r_C} = 0&#xA;$$&#xA;Substitute in the motor equation for torque from above:&#xA;$$&#xA;\frac{ K_Q\rho n_A^2 D^5}{r_A} + \frac{K_Q\rho n_B^2 D^5}{r_B} + \frac{K_Q\rho n_C^2 D^5}{r_C} = 0&#xA;$$&#xA;And get rid of the common constants:&#xA;$$&#xA;\frac{n_A^2}{r_A} + \frac{n_B^2}{r_B} + \frac{n_C^2}{r_C} = 0&#xA;$$&#xA;To solve this equation, we need to make a system of equations with the thrust for each motor:&#xA;$$&#xA;T_A + T_B + T_C = mg&#xA;$$&#xA;$$&#xA;K_T\rho n_A^2 D^4 + K_T\rho n_B^2 D^4 + K_T\rho n_C^2 D^4 = mg&#xA;$$&#xA;$$&#xA;n_A^2 + n_B^2 + n_C^2  = \frac{mg}{K_T\rho D^4} = C&#xA;$$&#xA;Where C is some constant. We don't really care what it is as long as it's non-zero (if it's zero then we don't need the motors to do anything).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, make our system of equations and solve them:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$&#xA;\frac{n_A^2}{r_A} + \frac{n_B^2}{r_B} + \frac{n_C^2}{r_C} = 0&#xA;$$&#xA;$$&#xA;n_A^2 + n_B^2 + n_C^2  =  C&#xA;$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Right away we see that there is no solution except when $C=0$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus, a trirotor needs the servo to rotate at least one motor in order to generate more torque without generating more thrust (in the z direction).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1524" LastActivityDate="2013-07-09T12:20:25.863" CommentCount="1" />

If you are using the motor at a high speed and thus low torque state, you will not approach the stall current and may stay within the spec for the motor driver.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, torque/speed curve is voltage dependent. If you operate at a lower voltage, you will draw less current and could possibly stay within spec for the H-bridge. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you exceed the recommended current draw for the H-Bridge, it will heat up and possibly burn out or in the worst case start a fire. The L293D has overtemp protection so it may just stop functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are ways to increase the max current capacity of the H-bridge by introducing cooling in the form of a heat sink or fan or liquid cooling, etc. The current through the H-bridge is causing resistive heating of the chip. The heating raises the temperature of the chip eventually causing damage.

If the &lt;em&gt;SRF&lt;/em&gt; detects anything closer, you immediately start the motor unspooling the cord and the spider will start dropping.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the spider is dropping you continue monitoring the &lt;em&gt;SRF&lt;/em&gt; and stop unspooling when the length of cord you've unspooled is approximately the same as the &lt;em&gt;minimum&lt;/em&gt; distance measured by the &lt;em&gt;SRF&lt;/em&gt; since it started dropping. This should place the spider right at eye level of the tallest person there, for maximum effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, after a short delay, start the motor slowly returning to it's rest position by spooling the cord back in and resetting for the next &lt;em&gt;attack&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Complications&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You will need to be careful about the weight of the spider. It needs to be heavy enough that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_%28physics%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;drag (air resistance)&lt;/a&gt; does not significantly impede it's acceleration due to gravity, but not so heavy that it could harm anyone or overload your motor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if your spider isn't &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; heavy, you will want to make sure that there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Larp-Arrows&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;1.5 to 2&quot; of foam&lt;/a&gt; between the heavy centre and anything that might touch anyone. You will also need to make sure that there are no stiffening wires or springs which can end up protruding out of the spider as it wears. All basic health and safety stuff really.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the spider is dropping into the SRF sensor beam area, then obviously you will not be able to improve your initial estimate of drop distance, and will just have to drop to that first range measured. This might mean that you end up dropping to teh height of someone's hand rather than to the level of their head though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to be clever, you can arrange your drop trajectory to be controlled so that you never have too much loose cord, this will minimise the risk of the cord getting tangled and snagging on anything. In this case you will want to ramp up the speed of the motor such that the cord is being spooled out at the same rate as the acceleration of the spider due to gravity, i.e. $9.8 ms^{-2}$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may or may not also want to control the deceleration rate as you approach the desired drop length. The faster you stop it, the more dramatically the spider will bounce and jump around, but the more stress you will put your system under.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, you will want to size your motor such that it can move relatively quickly under light load (when dropping) but still have the torque to stop the spider at the end of travel (and winch the spider back up).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Some calculations&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The formulae for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration#Uniform_acceleration&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;uniform acceleration&lt;/a&gt; is $s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2$ where $s$ is displacement, $u$ is initial velocity (zero in our case), $a$ is uniform acceleration and $t$ is time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assuming that you have a spool of 10cm in circumference, and want to drop the spider at most 2m then $s=2$, $u=0$, $a=9.8$ and $t$ is unknown: $t=\sqrt{\frac{2}{\frac{9.8}{2}}}=0.638$. To spool 2m in that time seconds would require the spool to turn at almost 2000 rpm on average ($200/10/0.638*60=1881$).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This seems a little unreasonable, so doubling the spool to 20cm circumference would drop the motor speed to under 1000rpm on average, but we are now looking at quite a bulky bit of mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you get the design right, you might even be able to fit all of the components needed (spider, spool, motor, drive electronics, control electronics, sensor and power supply) into something which you can screw into a light fitting and thus hide in a (large) lamp shade.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="37" LastEditorUserId="37" LastEditDate="2013-07-10T22:43:45.287" LastActivityDate="2013-07-10T22:43:45.287" CommentCount="1" />

Acoustic sensing is a complicated field of study, a significant part of which is spent guessing what path a sound wave took between sending it and receiving it.  As you've noticed, assuming that it went straight out and came straight back will produce odd results in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To really solve it, you'll need to use a system that places a unique frequency and/or tone length on each sensor.

If you wanted to simply detect the crosstalk, it would be a matter of firing a single sensor's pulse in between the firing of all sensors' pulses.  If you detect the return pulse with any other sensor, you know that you are in a crosstalk situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In practice, this is fairly wasteful: notice that this effectively halves the number of samples you can take.  So you can improve on the implementation by dividing the sensors into groups where each member of the group is far enough from the others that it will not receive crosstalk.  The most robust version of this approach is to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~johannb/Papers/paper32.pdf&quot;&gt;make the groups themselves be pseudorandom&lt;/a&gt; which not only allows the errors to average out over time but aids the detection of crosstalk on an individual sensor basis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In your particular case, you have the added benefit of a camera sensor that you've shown is returning a more correct value for the ranges.  Strategies to combine separate (and possibly conflicting) measurements into a single more accurate estimate is its own very broad topic (called &lt;em&gt;fusion&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;amp;arnumber=363924&quot;&gt;example 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://eia.udg.es/~qsalvi/papers/2009-MARTECH.pdf&quot;&gt;example 2&lt;/a&gt;), but a very relevant one to what you're doing here.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="350" LastActivityDate="2013-07-12T03:06:14.600" />

Yes, the receiver is spread-spectrum, but interference to such a receiver will generally raise its noise floor, which will reduce its range.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The receiver could be faulty; it's front end could be getting swamped by the 910MHz.  This would reduce the effective gain of the receiver front end, which would also result in low range.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's even a slight chance that the problem is neither one, but some other bit of electronics: the 910MHz signal could be getting rectified by some component in a servo or other bit of electronics.  This would generate signal at 1.82GHz, 2.73GHz and more -- that 2.73GHz signal, if it's strong enough, could cause issues with your 2.4GHz receiver.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A rough test of which is which would be to unhook one or the other from the quadcopter, then increase the separation between them while you see how the signal strength, or range, looks on the 2.4GHz receiver.  If the range of the 2.4GHz receiver rises rapidly with separation, or shows some threshold effect where it is low, low, low, HIGH, then there's a good chance that the problem is that the 2.4GHz receiver is allowing itself to be stomped on by the out-of-band energy from the transmitter.  If the range of the 2.4GHz receiver rises gradually and smoothly as you back away from the video transmitter, then the problem could be in either radio but is most likely in the transmitter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world both the receiver and the video transmitters would be inside of metal boxes, with bandpass filters right at the point of entry or exit for the RF signal that only let the correct frequencies through.  Those metal boxes would weigh nothing, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alas, this is the real world.  I'm not sure if it'd be worthwhile to try the metal box idea -- the required filters are hard to debug without a spectrum analyzer; you can put one together and see if it works, but if it doesn't you still won't know for sure if a filter isn't the answer, or if that particular filter didn't do the job for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The (US) Amateur Radio Relay League has a book called the &quot;Radio Interference Handbook&quot;.

Alas, this leaves &quot;blind spots&quot; between transducers where objects can't be seen by any transducer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some combination — for example, increase the angle from one sensor to another so one sensor only hears echoes from its 2 neighbors (about half the beam angle); then alternate between pinging the even transducers (ignoring the odd transducers) and pinging the odd transducers (ignoring the even transducers).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Each transducer operating at a different frequency.

If the right receiver gets an echo back 5 ms later both times, then you can be pretty sure it's a real echo; if the right receiver gets an echo back 5 ms later the first time, 6 ms later the second time, it's probably a ghost from the left receiver. (There are much more sophisticated &quot;spread spectrum&quot; techniques for separating out many transmitters all using the same frequency at the same time.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Combine the signals from all the receivers. If you have one central transmitter that pings in all directions (or equivalently you have transmitters pointed in every direction, and you ping them all at the same instant), and the first echo you get back hits the left receiver first (then later the right receiver hears an echo), you know that the nearest obstacle is closer to the left side than the right side. (There are more sophisticated &quot;phased array&quot; techniques that combine signals from all the receivers, and even more sophisticated &quot;beamforming&quot; techniques for slightly adjusting the transmit times of all the transmitters.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;P.S.: Have you seen &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.societyofrobots.com/member_tutorials/node/71&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;Infrared vs. Ultrasonic — What You Should Know&quot;&lt;/a&gt; ?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Yes, I've said this all before, at &lt;a href=&quot;http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/24835/multiple-ultrasonic-rangefinder-question&quot;&gt;&quot;Multiple Ultrasonic Rangefinder Question&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="187" LastEditorUserId="1177" LastEditDate="2013-12-31T03:22:58.930" LastActivityDate="2013-12-31T03:22:58.930" />

I believe that this is mostly due to the inductance of the motor, which is listed in the good data sheets.  Fancy stepper drives are current-controlled, to try to drive the current to the data sheet value quickly, in spite of the stepper's inductance (and maybe back-EMF).  They do this by driving higher voltage into the stepper than its continuous-duty rating.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;More subtly, accelerating a mechanism requires torque, and decelerating it requires torque in the other direction.

In 1980, the Robot Institute of America (RIA), an industrial trade group, came up with the following definition:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;A robot is a reprogrammable multifunctional manipulator designed to move material, parts, tools, or specialized devices through variable programmed motions for the performance of a variety of tasks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;These days, this definition would be considered too restrictive, as it reflects the concentration of the RIA on robot manipulators on an assembly line. Robotics has broadened over the years in many ways: to include mobility platforms, to address the service sector as well as the manufacturing sector, and to incorporate man-machine interactions, not just autonomy, in telerobotic and virtual reality systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately he does not offer an alternative definition outright, that I recall. Instead he discusses the elements of a robot system which he lists as:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mechanical Structure&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Actuators&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sensors&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Computer Controller&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is arguable whether the computer controller is even necessary because mechanisms can be built that respond to environmental stimuli without the explicit aid of a computer (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ted.com/2007/11/27/robert_full/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dr. Robert Full&lt;/a&gt;'s work). In AI we call such things reflex agents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we accept the first three elements (or all four) then our world is overrun by robots. This is a bit unsatisfying for many because we often envision the robots from SciFi. If we don't then the definition becomes arbitrary as @Ian points out because we cannot draw a distinction between two devices with the same components wherein we call one a robot (e.g. 3D printer) and another we don't (e.g. microwave) as you implicitly observe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regardless it is generally accepted that these are the elements of a robot. This of course gives rise to the question, did we have robots before we had the term &quot;robot?&quot; The answer to this question is yes (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/533/what-was-the-earliest-concept-of-a-robot/547#547&quot;&gt;What is the earliest concept of a robot?&lt;/a&gt;).

The Three Laws are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since I’m referencing Wikipedia verses presenting any original thought, I might as well &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;continue&lt;/a&gt;: (reference: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A robot is a mechanical or virtual agent, usually an electro-mechanical machine that is guided by a computer program or electronic circuitry. ...

While I was programming the movement of the legs I noticed that they moved rather stiffly. It makes sense that the RC servo's internal controller would have a very quick response to position commands, but I wanted my crawler to move in a way that seems a little more smooth and life-like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My solution was create a cubic function of time that describes the path of the servos, and then set their position in small time increments, resulting in more smooth motion. Essentially what I did was solve for the $a_i$ coefficients in a cubic equation using the time interval, starting and ending position of the servo, and starting and ending rates the servo should move (which is just the derivative of the position):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Solve for $a_0$, $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$ position(t) = a_0 + a_1t + a_2t^2 + a_3t^3 $$&#xA;$$ rate(t) = position'(t) = a_1 + 2a_2t + 3a_3t^2 $$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given: $position(0)$, $position(t_f)$, $rate(0)$, $rate(t_f)$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I set the rate of the servo between a pair of movements to be zero if the movements were in opposite directions, and positive or negative if the movements were both in the positive or negative direction, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This worked pretty well, but this solution is limited in a few ways. For one, it's difficult to decide what exactly the rates between movements that go in the same direction should be. I used the average of the slopes ahead and behind of a particular position between movements, but it isn't clear to me that is optimal. Second of all, cubic curves could take the servo to a position outside of the range of the positions at the beginning and end of a movement, which may be undesirable. For example, at some point during the time interval, the curve could cause the servo to go beyond the second position, or below the first position. Thirdly, curve generation here does not consider the maximum rate that the servo can turn, so a curve may have the servo move at a speed that is unrealistic. With that, a minor concern is that the maximum turning rate depends on the response of servo's internal controller, and may change depending on the size of the position interval. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Neglecting that last concern, these issues may be solved by increasing the degree of the polynomial and adding constraints to solve for the coefficients, but I'm now starting to wonder...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is there a better way than this to make servo movement smooth and seem more life-like?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="181" LastEditorUserId="350" LastEditDate="2013-08-05T12:57:41.913" LastActivityDate="2013-08-05T12:57:41.913" Title="Smooth servo movement for a crawling robot" Tags="&lt;servos&gt;&lt;kinematics&gt;&lt;crawler&gt;" AnswerCount="2" CommentCount="17" FavoriteCount="2" />

As I suggested in &lt;a href=&quot;http://robotics.stackexchange.com/a/1234/37&quot;&gt;my answer to a similar question&lt;/a&gt;, if you keep both wheels within a very tight error bound of where you ask them to be, then it will take some time to accumulate enough of an error to cause noticeable veer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It will also be much easier to tune two nominally independent Motor level PID loops than to tune a single complex, interdependent combined system. To stand any change of the higher level control working you really need each motor to behave as similarly as possible to the other motor for as much of the time as possible, and that really requires separate servo loops.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of further complications however, and it depends what accuracy you need and how much effort you are prepared to go to to correct for them as to which solution you go for. It may be that &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dead Reckoning&lt;/a&gt; is sufficient, or you may need to add Relative or Absolute position determination to your robot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One problem is that even if your left and right wheels both move 1000 encoder counts, you &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; still end up in a different position on two different runs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, say you have a maximum following error of 10 encoder counts, and your motors are running at a speed of say 10 encoder counts per PID loop iteration. Your left motor might move 5,10,10,10...10,5 while your right motor might have a profile of 4,11,10,10...10,5 and even that slight difference in acceleration at the start of the move could cause the robot to set off in slightly the wrong direction. Not only that but the further you move in that direction, the greater the error will become in absolute terms. This is what we are talking about when we talk of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbe_error&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Abbe error&lt;/a&gt;, and without a complex kinematic model or some sort of external reference, you are never going to be able to correct for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://robotics.stackexchange.com/a/1234/37&quot;&gt;my answer&lt;/a&gt; to a similar but not quite duplicate question: &lt;a href=&quot;http://robotics.stackexchange.com/q/1232/37&quot;&gt;How can I use the Arduino PID library to drive a robot in a straight line?&lt;/a&gt; &#xA;and &lt;a href=&quot;http://robotics.stackexchange.com/a/1527/37&quot;&gt;my answer&lt;/a&gt; to the also related &lt;a href=&quot;http://robotics.stackexchange.com/q/1524/37&quot;&gt;Line Follower optimization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="37" LastEditorUserId="37" LastEditDate="2013-08-07T16:42:16.877" LastActivityDate="2013-08-07T16:42:16.877" CommentCount="5" />

There's also brilliant simulation software available, that basically guarantees worst case response times (for instance RealTime-at-work has a free CAN bus analyser called RTaW-Sim). And finally, it would seem the availability of MEMS sensors with integrated CAN is rather poor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another example where actuators are configured as a bus (or ring), is Dynamixels AX and MX series, where each motor is daisy chained to the next via a UART link. This greatly simplifies system design if you have a large amount of actuators.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, to get back to the actual question, I think if you describe your system as real-time set points, instead of commands (eg rather continuously broadcast a motor angle than instructing a command such as goto angle), it simplifies the coupling between the 200 Hz and 30 Hz loop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1775" LastActivityDate="2013-08-07T13:36:08.673" />

(I don't know if the DPS is per nozzle or per head.) The later 890C with a 192-nozzle head produced 12000 drops per second with 10 pL per drop, or about 8.3 s to deliver 1 µL of ink.

Since SLAM is a problem (or at least a technique), not a solution, there is no definitive SLAM algorithm.  Semantically, you have to decide what goes on a &quot;map&quot; of the environment, and that determines how your algorithm should handle transient (aka moving) signals. But that's a digression.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Permanent maps:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Permanent maps should contain enough information to localize yourself with respect to known geometry. Typically used in buildings. Typically human-readable. See Willow-Garage's work. or anything by Thrun in his quite famous textbook. If you lose this map, you have to build it up over time again. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removing objects. Yes, the object will appear in a static map for a time. If no measures are taken to remove previously-detected objects, then it will persist. A typical 2D grid-based representation will use each grid cell to represent the probability of an object, so after time the object will &quot;fade&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding objects. Same as above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Local maps:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In reality, SLAM is usually used to localize a robot as it moves, and the map is not kept permanently (or, it is kept permanently, but only the closest Y features are used). Local maps are whatever the robot needs to know to determine how it moved in the last X minutes, where X depends on the application. If you lose the map, you can still fly just fine by using whatever features are in sight right now. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Batch methods such as Bundle Adjustment using visual features is a very common technique in this direction. Features may be kept over time, and even revisited, but a moving feature is just an unreliable feature, and it will be ignored when trying to figure out where the robot is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visual SLAM is exactly this. It is a delta-P (change in pose) estimator, not a map-based localization algorithm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, as long as most things are &lt;em&gt;not currently&lt;/em&gt; moving, it doesn't matter if you remove an object when the robot isn't &quot;looking&quot; at it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Example&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So do this. When you read a SLAM paper, decide the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are they really building a map?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are they just keeping a list of features and locations?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If so, what &quot;features&quot; go in the map? Lines, points, visual features?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are these features likely to move? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If so, how can they handle that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, sensor noise often &quot;looks&quot; like moving features. How do they handle sensor noise? Because this will often determine what happens to moving features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You'll get a different answer for each paper / author / book / application. In short, they are typically omitted since they don't help the robot localize much, and can be avoided by simply having a few low-level path planner that only uses local information. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Good luck, slam is a huge topic.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="163" LastEditorUserId="163" LastEditDate="2013-08-12T14:13:50.577" LastActivityDate="2013-08-12T14:13:50.577" CommentCount="8" />

All this would happen without any CPU intervention (freeing you up to do other things).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This type of behind-the-scenes triggering allows you to get a lot more work done compared to when you would have had an ISR controlling all the enable flags or memory reads (due to the overhead associated with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt_latency&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;interrupt latency&lt;/a&gt;).

If the noise is white, then each sample in perfectly independent of any other sample.  If the noise is Laplacian, each sample obeys the Laplace distribution.  Kalman filters don't like colored noise (but you can deal with that by adding states).  A Kalman filter is only the overall optimal filter when the noise is of Gaussian distribution and the cost function is sum-of-squares.  For any other noise and cost function, the optimal filter is probably nonlinear.  But for any zero-mean, white noise and sum-of-squares cost function, the Kalman filter is the best linear filter to be found.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Note that the system model I gave ends up with a pretty trivial Kalman filter -- you may be better off, if you can't find some other means of estimating compass offset, using a complimentary filter to combine these two sensor inputs.  Doing all the Kalman computations will just end up coughing up a complimentary filter anyway, and chances are that you'll have enough guesses for your constants that you may as well just guess at the crossover point in a complimentary filter and be done with it).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Note, too, that if you have some absolute &lt;em&gt;position&lt;/em&gt; reference, and some means estimating speed, and a vehicle that always goes in the direction you point it, that you can use an extended Kalman filter very profitably to correct the compass distortion by using the direction it actually moves to correct for the compass direction).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Optimal State Estimation&quot; by Dan Simon, Wiley 2006, is -- in my opinion -- a very rich and clear treatment of the subject of Kalman filtering and its more sophisticated brethren (H-infinity, extended Kalman, unscented Kalman, and even a bit on Baysian and particle filtering).

Generally you can either have each robot sense it's own position or have some sort of system find the robots and send them information about their position (or a combination).  Possibly using other robot positions to locate yourself is another option if they can communicate.  You could also combine sensor information from the robots and other sources.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can encode either absolute position or relative position on the floor or ceiling.  A sensor on the robot can look at those.  A sensor like the one in your optical mouse can get relative motion off most surfaces even without any pattern.  There were older style mice that used a patterned grid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could have two (or more) cameras on every robot looking at different directions, if the walls of the room have the right kind of pattern you could determine your location based on the images.  A spinning camera is another option.  Obstruction of the camera by other robots may be a concern.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A sensor array or camera in the floor or ceiling could locate the robots and then you can send the robots their location.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some sort of spinning optical sensor that can locate the direction of an optical beacon (e.g. a LED).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sound&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could have a few beacons around emitting ultrasound chirps.  If they are all synchronized (e.g. fixed delay between them) then given their location you could use a time of flight calculation to determine the position of the robot.  Many years ago I've worked with an ultrasound digitizer that was accurate to about a mm over a distance of about a meter so it seems in the ballpark.  Depending on the shape of your robot and the configuration of the swarm reflections and obstructions may or may not be a problem.  You would need to experiment but my gut feeling is that with enough beacons you could good performance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultrasound range finders on every robot.  (spinning?)

Strafing is affected only by the angle of the rollers relative to the wheels, and you shouldn't need to worry about that for standard mecanums.

If you power each of your Rover 5 motors with 12V (I don't know what they're rated for), you'll see that each motor will spin at slightly different speeds. If you want to guarantee you're traveling in a straight line, you need to implement velocity control on both wheels. One method of doing this is implementing a PID controller on the drive wheels to ensure their velocity is the same, based on encoder ticks per unit time. Otherwise (let's assume you have two wheels that are driving the vehicle) one wheel will turn faster than the other, and you'll slowly drift in one direction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, you may want to turn a vehicle with no steering control! That means you want to turn your drive wheels at different velocities (albeit this will cause your wheels to slip horizontally and thus cause you to lose some traction/power), and so you need two different encoders that will be the input to two different velocity controllers. For a tank like system, if the front left wheel encoder is ticking and the rear left wheel encoder is NOT ticking, then maybe your tread has fallen off! It's really very useful to create a robust system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edit: Man I keep editing and adding more stuff...having multiple encoders will also allow you to identify failures.

There are several major areas where successful teams tend to excel. Following are a few in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sensors: Learning to use sensors is simultaneously the hardest and best thing you can do to improve performance. Using sensors well can increase reliability and repeatability when performing tasks. In other words it can improve the performance of the robot by making it more accurate. Start with something simple like learning how to use bump sensors. Then try something a little more complicated like learning how to use color sensors considering how their output changes given different lighting conditions. If you are really up for a challenge then you can learn how to do &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nxtprograms.com/line_follower/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;line following&lt;/a&gt;. The most successful teams I have seen make line following a core component.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Programming: Many tasks require the same functionality. For instance, you can use line following to get from home base to the various challenges. You can either put this functionality into each of your programs directly or you can use &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nxtprograms.com/help/MyBlocks/tutorial.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;My Blocks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to build the functionality once and use it over and over in your programs. Doing so has the added benefit of making your code more reliable because once it has been written and tested you know it works. It has the added benefit of making your programs smaller allowing you to fit more programs. This can be great for testing. But be careful, too many programs can make switching programs during a challenge time consuming.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Attachments: Changing attachments during the competition is a major time sink. Learning to design attachments that can be used to perform multiple tasks saves time and helps score many points. Try making different types of attachments and focus on learning how to make them rigid and strong.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Stability: Tipping over during a challenge can cost you points as a result of touching the robot while it's away from home base. Practice building chassis that avoiding tipping when the robot turns and interacts with objects in the environment.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Team: FLL emphasizes team building for a reason. A good team can divide the numerous tasks necessary to be successful and can help each other when challenges arise. Learn how to communicate with your team members especially when you disagree. This will show through when you are in the various judging rooms which can earn you a prize in-and-of-itself.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="177" LastActivityDate="2013-10-05T06:23:44.090" />

If you identify zero landmarks, then you can't do anything! By including odometry, we no longer have an ambiguity.

(otherwise use EKF, PF, or some variant).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There's a wall at &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; $x=10$ which the robot can measure distance to.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The robot has a laser scanner to get distance with sensor variance $\sigma_l^2=.1$&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The robot can measure it's distance travelled with odometers using sensor variance $\sigma_o^2 = .5$. Clearly the laser is more accurate than the odos.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's how the robot handles SLAM in this simple environment. (note this is actually localization since we aren't updating the position of the wall).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The robot tries to move one unit to the right.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Odometry measures $x=.9$&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Laser scanner says you are $8.8$ units from the wall.

In this case, the laser is the best right? So obviously I'm at $x=1.2$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you choose the one &quot;closest&quot; to what you expect?

The transmitted acoustic energy is reflected from boundaries between various layers with different acoustic impedances [i.e. the air and the paper]. Acoustic impedance is defined by the bulk density of the medium times the velocity of the sound within that medium. The reflected acoustic signal is received [by one or more microphones].

You should still pay attention that if only one of the sensors is showing such a value, for example 0.5, it is likely that you are just going out of the line and it's measuring a half white/half black location.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you really want to detect the actual color you have to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use three grey-scale sensors instead of one at each location.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On each of the three, mount a color filter; one green, one blue and one red.

The measurements are visible, but the true state is hidden. You now want to infer the true states.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As usual, this method relies on a set of parameters and -- in principle -- the way to obtain the best point-estimate for the parameters is to look at the likelihood for the data (given the parameters) and optimising your parameters to obtain the maximum value. This gives you the maximum likelihood estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, in the case of the Kalman filter, this approach is not so easy and intractable to do in closed form. This is because we do not observe the hidden states. Therefore, one has to apply some tricks. One of them is to use the Expecation Maximisation (EM) Algorithm, which is an iterative approach: In the first step, you calculate the most likely value for your hidden states (the expected value) under your current parameters. In the second step, you keep the hidden states fixed and optimise the parameters to obtain the solution with highest likelihood. These steps are repeated until convergence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can read up on the general concept of EM in a whole bunch of text books on machine learning (only one example: &lt;a href=&quot;http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Brml.HomePage&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning&quot;&lt;/a&gt; by David Barber).

The state vector has 12 variables. Each time I carry out a prediction step, my transfer function (naturally) acts on the entire state. However, my sensors provide measurements of different parts of the robot's state, so I may get roll, pitch, yaw and their respective velocities in one measurement, and then linear velocity in another.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My approach to handling this so far has been to simply create sub-matrices for the covariance, carry out my standard UKF update equations, and then stick the resulting values back into the full covariance matrix. However, after a few updates, the UKF yells at me for trying to pass a matrix that isn't positive-definite into a Cholesky Decomposition function. Clearly the covariance is losing its positive-definite properties, and I'm guessing it has to do with my attempts to update subsets of the full covariance matrix. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an example taken from an actual log file, the following matrix (after the UKF prediction step) is positive-definite:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;

Is there a better solution?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, am I missing a step that would keep my covariance matrix as positive-definite?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EDIT:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It looks like I'm not properly placing the values back into the original covariance matrix. Simply copying the values back isn't sufficient. I need to track the correlation coefficients for the covariance matrix, and make sure that when I update a variance value, I update all the values in its row/column to maintain the correlation coefficient value. I have to do some more testing to verify that this is my issue, but some initial analysis in Matlab suggests that it is. If I'm correct, I'll answer my own question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EDIT 2:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given the response below and after trying it, I can see that my original edit idea won't fly. However, I have one more question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As this is a UKF, I don't actually have Jacobian matrices. I think I see how I would make it work within the UKF update equations, but even in an EKF - and I ask because I have one of those as well - my state-to-measurement function $h$ is going to end up being the identity matrix, as I am directly measuring my state variables. In the case, I take it my &quot;Jacobian&quot; would just be an $m \times n$ matrix with ones in the $(i, i)$ location, where $i$ is the index of the measured values in the measurement vector?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2176" LastEditorUserId="2176" LastEditDate="2013-11-01T13:31:19.383" LastActivityDate="2013-11-01T13:31:19.383" Title="Maintaining positive-definite property for covariance in an unscented Kalman filter update" Tags="&lt;kalman-filter&gt;" AnswerCount="1" />

You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do a propogation step on a submatrix, however. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is because of the cross-covariance terms (which &quot;spread&quot; information across different parts of the state). This is why having a more accurate estimate of your heading will lead to more accurate position estimates, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, following your edit, simply updating the cross-correlation (covariance) terms won't do it either, you need to update the whole matrix (unless you know &lt;em&gt;for sure&lt;/em&gt; that some elements are independent, conditioned on the state estimate.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Here you go:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To do this, form the Jacobian matrices as before, but note that there should be zeros in all off-diagonal elements when no part of that state is being measured. Then the magic of matrix inversion will spread the innovation corrections to the correct parts of the state. The Jacobian matrix &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be of size $n\times m$ for $m$ measured values and $n$ state variables (or $m\times n$ depending on your definition of Jacobian). None of this &quot;update part of the covariance junk&quot; unless you know &lt;em&gt;for sure&lt;/em&gt; that the Jacobian elements are equivalent to identity. The safest way is to use the full Jacobian.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Other hacks (once everything is theoretically correct)&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, this &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; won't ensure PD covariance matrices.&#xA;I strongly &lt;em&gt;strongly&lt;/em&gt; recommend you don't do the following hacks until you fix all the other mistakes. But in the end, for a field-deploy-able system that operates for non-trivial amounts of time, I've found it is almost always necessary to do the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all updates, Let covariance $P$ be $P\gets \frac{1}{2}P + \frac{1}{2}P^{T}$, just to &quot;even out&quot; the off-diagonal terms -- for symmetry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let $P\gets P + \epsilon I_{n\times n}$, where $\epsilon$ is a small scalar to ensure you don't underflow (and wreck the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condition_number&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;condition number&lt;/a&gt; of your matrix)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="163" LastActivityDate="2013-10-31T17:03:43.553" CommentCount="1" />

The third column of the first row is sigma_xz, and is nonzero, which means, according to your covariance matrix, the random variable z is correlated to the random variable x, and so changes in x will affect z. If you further analyze your covariance matrix, it seems that Z is correlated to Y (element (2,3) of covariance matrix is nonzero) and, of course, itself (element (3,3) of covariance matrix). For the velocities, it certainly makes sense that updates in position will update your velocity because the EKF is simply capturing information regarding changes in state. Again if you look at the covariance matrix, I assume the 7th, 8th and 9th elements of your state vector are the velocity in x, y and z. In the covariance matrix, the elements (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9) are all nonzero so the 3 velocities are correlated to your x position...further analysis shows that they're also correlated to your Y and Z position by similar arguments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1960" LastActivityDate="2013-11-01T17:32:16.437" />

For example, in table 1 of the datasheet of the BMA020 accelerometer you have the entry &quot;Sensitivity&quot;. Probably you are operating your sensor with a 2g range. If your sensor has a temperature of 25°C, according to the datasheet the raw output of your sensor is typically 256 LSB if it is exposed to a acceleration of 1.0 g. As specified in the datasheet, this is only the typical value. Each manufactured sensor is a little bit different and thus the &quot;min&quot; and &quot;max&quot; columns define other possible values, depending on your specific sensor. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In your question you talk about measurements in g units and not in LSB. Thus, the code operating your accelerometer already converts the raw measurements to g units. The conversion algorithm can range from very simple algorithms to very sophisticated algorithms. An ideal conversion algorithm would incorporate all errors your sensor makes due to production variations and due to the current operation conditions. To compensate for the production variations this conversion algorithm should make use of calibration values which you found for your specific accelerometer or which are known from factory calibration (expensive sensors). Additionally, if you look at your datasheet again, you see that the sensitivity of your accelerometer depends on the operation temperature. Thus, if the defined error due to temperature change is too high for your application, you need to add an temperature sensor and your conversion algorithm should use the temperature to correct for this error too. There are also additional error sources defined in the datasheet and the algorithm for converting your raw measurements to g units can get very sophisticated. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the reason why your sensors don't output 1 g is simply that you're using some conversion algorithm to get from the raw sensor readings to g units and this algorithm probably neither uses any calibrated values specific to your sensor nor does it incorporate the current environment conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2189" LastActivityDate="2013-11-02T22:30:28.927" />

  <row Id="2023" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="2022" CreationDate="2013-11-05T11:50:32.130" Score="1" Body="&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of advancement on the software side, but there are many reasons why we don't currently see them on robots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, notice that there are a huge variety of robots already built or possibly built in the future. So let's look at a couple of them:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Manipulators: A manipulator is just an arm. You define a task for it, it does it. It's dumb, it's big and it's plugged in the wall at some factory. Do you really need AI or parallel processing for a manipulator? Does the programming language even matter? Probably not.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Small mobile robots: a variety of robots are small, or could be small. The biggest issue on those robots is power. To process heavily, you need more power. To provide more power, you need bigger batteries. To carry bigger batteries you need stronger motors. Stronger motors are big and need a bigger support. In short, small robots have to be really energy efficient, that's why they also can't be processing too much. GPGPU's and complicated AI is usually off limits for those robots.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Humanoids: This is probably what you have been thinking when you asked the question. So let's continue this answer assuming you are talking about humanoids, or more generally big mobile robots.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What will be the implications of GPGPU, Multi-core and &quot;programming in the large&quot; model in the specific case of embedded software,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It would be great! Besides the fact that you need proper hardware (actual computers vs. microcontrollers), it would be great. I believe this would specifically be helpful on areas where there is need for processing of huge input data, such as vision or tactile input.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;and how will it influence the styles and conventions in the community?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Probably not much. Software is done in modules. Someone writes an odometry module and you use it. If they change the odometry implementation underneath, you won't notice it (much). Using GPGPUs is low-level enough to be part of lower level libraries, and often the actual users (programmers) of the robot would be unaware of it. Multi-core processing is all too easy and I think it's already widely used (you just make threads!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Functional Programming has supposedly started reaching the masses. It was late night previous weekend when I briefly skimmed through an example of functional reactive programming to solve real time problems. AI people are also suggesting that we should be programming our robots in Declarative Domain Specific languages soon. It would be nice to know the implications on the robotics community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically all non-joke (and even some joke) programming languages we have are turing-complete. This means that they can all get the job done. So choosing a language is really just a matter of convenience. Currently, C is the ubiqutous languange for every architecture. Everything can link to C and C is compiled on the remotest microcontroller on this planet. I don't think C could be put aside.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For higher level programming, I don't see any reason why any language couldn't be used. If the robot is controlled by a computer (vs. a microcontroller), it can probably run anything compiled or interpreted in any language.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding real-time, probably you are misusing the word. If you are actually referring to an actual &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;real-time system&lt;/a&gt;, then probably the biggest obstacles are the tools. Believe it or not, there are not many good ones. I program in real-time and trust me, there's something wrong with each of them. Still, you'd probably be forced to write in C or C++ if you want to use any of those tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;There has been a tremendous growth of frameworks like ROS and Urbi too!! That should be the region to look upon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know Urbi, but I know ROS. ROS is quite famous, and everything you make, people immediately request a ROS module. It's nice, it works, but it's not perfect. Biggest flaw is that it can't be real-time, but they can't really be blamed. What I mean is, it's not a region to look upon, it's a region where people are already at.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Most of the robotics, embedded and high performance AI codebase directly depends on C/C++, and though languages like Rust and D are bubbling up, wouldn't it take massive amount of time to adopt the new languages, if ever adaptation begins?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It sure will. As for embedded systems, I doubt it would ever change away from C, definitely not to a functional language. C is quite low-level yet very high-level. It's at the exact sweet spot for embedded programming. You can be portable yet have access to all hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Embedded programming is in direct violation of most of what's important in a functional language. The fact that you are working with hardware means that the functions can't be pure (in Haskell, they would be IO). So what would be the benefit of functional programming if most functions are not-pure and their results can't be cached? Besides, it's not even practical to load a whole interpreter of a functional language in a tiny microcontroller and hope to be able to use all sorts of dynamic caching during runtime to compensate for lack of non-functional language structures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short for microcontrollers, functional languages simply aren't fit. For &quot;high performance AI codebases&quot;, there is again no reason why they can't be used. It's just that people have to pick up one of those languages and start using it. Biggest problem is though that People are lazy and don't like change.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Correct me, but it seems like a lot of time has passed and there are not many major production results from the AI community. I've heard about cognitive architectures of old like ACT-R and 4CAPS. They seem to be in hibernation mode!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They are not in hibernation mode. The nature of the research has changed. Take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifical_intelligence#History&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a very brief history of AI on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. Whereas in the 80s you would see for example a lot of algorithms developed on solving NP-complete problems, now you see artifical intelligence for example in Kinect that you usually don't think of as &quot;intelligent&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is also a lot of way more complicated research going on such as cognitive science and others. My personal feeling is that they are still maturing and not yet at a stage that could be widely used. Either that, or I have just been ignorant about it myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;There seems to be a lot of work lately on otherwise intelligent systems (solved problems) like Computer vision and Data mining, but these problems cater to supercomputing and industrial crowd more. Could there be any possible shift towards low powered systems soon?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Could there? Yes. Would there? Probably not. Like I said before, heavy processing requires power and power is very precious on a (mobile) robot. There would however definitely be a middle-ground used in robotics. Perhaps not a super complete AI, but a dumbed down, simpler one (but still more intelligent than current) would be placed on robots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="158" LastEditorUserId="158" LastEditDate="2013-11-05T13:28:38.440" LastActivityDate="2013-11-05T13:28:38.440" />

I'll give some detail about the board on the bottom, but I'm going to keep this question generic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First of all, regarding hardware. From what I've gathered, there isn't any need for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull-up_resistor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;pull-up resistor&lt;/a&gt; on the TX of CAN. Is that correct? It may perhaps be chip-specific, but wherever I see, it seems that the TX/RX lines are directly connected to the transceiver.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, regarding bit-timing: Using different calculators, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kvaser.com/en/support/bit-timing-calculator.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kvaser&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intrepidcs.com/support/mbtime.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the one from Microchip&lt;/a&gt;, I can see the following configuration (for 64&amp;nbsp;kHz input clock):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;             SYNC     PROP     PHASE1      PHASE2       BRP (prescaler)&#xA;&#xA;125  kbit/s   1        1        3           3            32&#xA;250  kbit/s   1        1        3           3            16&#xA;500  kbit/s   1        1        3           3             8&#xA;1000 kbit/s   1        1        3           3             4&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've seen this from more than one source. Furthermore, the numbers fit to the formula in the datasheet of the microcontroller.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, only the configuration for 125&amp;nbsp;kbit/s works for me. I'm using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esd-electronics-usa.com/esd-electronics-usa/canreal.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CANreal&lt;/a&gt; to monitor the messages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've tried different configurations for the CAN, for example with 16 time quanta instead of 8 as well as changing my microcontroller's clock to 16&amp;nbsp;MHz and using again different values. Regardless of all that, speeds higher than 125&amp;nbsp;kbit/s result in only errors and warnings in CANreal (which are taken from the CAN driver). Note that the same CAN board, driver and software works with 1&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s with some other hardware I have.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This all is made harder since, as soon as I put a probe from my oscillator on the TX line, it becomes a continuous 0-1 alteration like the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;      __------     __------     __------     __------     __------&#xA;     /       |    /       |    /       |    /       |    /       |&#xA;   /         |  /         |  /         |  /         |  /         |&#xA;  /          | /          | /          | /          | /          |&#xA;  |          | |          | |          | |          | |          |&#xA;  |          |_|          |_|          |_|          |_|          |&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which is not something I would be outputting by software. In fact, as soon as I remove the probe, the messages start arriving (again, only at 125&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s). So basically, I don't seem to be able to have any oscillator debugging available.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back to my &quot;first of all, regarding hardware&quot;, the shape of the signal suggests a pull-up resistor may be necessary, but I haven't seen the need for that in any datasheet I found. Furthermore, my microcontroller configures the pin when used as CAN, so I don't have control over making it push-pull (since it looks like it's &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_collector#MOSFET&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;open-drain&lt;/a&gt;). Not to mention the microcontroller doesn't even have a configuration to make the pin push-pull.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is there any hidden parameter somewhere that should also be set? Is a pull-up resistor necessary after all? Why would the oscillator probe cause such a behavior?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Details from the board:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;MCU&lt;/a&gt;: P18F45K80.

In microstepping mode the driving waveform at the motor terminals looks like a sine and cosine (sines offset by 90 degrees) and the driver modulates the outputs to maintain the current to the windings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 1.2A appears to be peak current.  So at standstill we're talking 1.2A*4V = 4.8W max per phase (though a microstepping driver will never drive those two phases &quot;fully&quot; simultaneously).  At any rate, at very slow speeds/standing we're talking about ~13W for the two motors vs. your 40W power supply.  So no problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you start speeding things up two things happen: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The motors starts acting as a generator producing counter-EMF (and we don't know the Ke constant for those motors).  Now to maintain the same current your driver has to overcome this counter-EMF.  This is why you want the highest voltage you can get if you're planning to run your motors at speed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We are going through the microstepping waveform and really start caring more about the RMS current (So we can effectively divide by ~1.4 since the power supply doesn't care about peak current as much over very short durations).  So about 0.86A RMS per phase.  That adds up to ~3.42A which is still lower (though not by much, than your 3.5A supply).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So as long as you're well below a speed where your back-EMF is ~8V you're fine.  If you plan to go to this point or above it you'll run out of voltage and you're also left with relatively small margins on power.  It also depends on how much power you need for the rest of your system.  Unfortunately I'm not quite sure how to calculate the back-EMF constant (Ke) from your motor parameters.  Looking at the pulling torque curve (given with a 24V supply) I would guess that up to 1000-2000pps you'll still be OK and it looks like the torque is dropping by ~25% over ~1500pps so it's probably in the range of 6V/1500pps (very rough guess).  Since we know the inductance maybe someone can show us how to calculate back-EMF constant (I'd be interested in learning)...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1584" LastActivityDate="2013-11-11T04:31:54.027" CommentCount="2" />

I have not attempted to use the higher level programming languages such as Java and C++ because most of the applications that I have been using would not have benefited from the advanced functions. If you are wanting these advanced functions is NXT the right hardware?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;One might also like to know (1) which (if any) of these alternatives supports hard real-time systems&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This post for the LeJOS discuses this with regards to Java: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lejos.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;amp;t=4619&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.lejos.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;amp;t=4619&lt;/a&gt; :- &quot;The NXT firmware switches thread contexts every 1ms. Also, the scheduler of the NXT firmware is much more predictable. For example, a thread with high priority would be preferred by the scheduler over any thread with lower priority. So high priority threads could be pretty sure to be scheduled as soon as possible. The motor regulation was typically running as a high priority thread. But as you already guessed, the NXT firmware was no realtime system either. Threads with the same priority are served round-robin. Oh and once in a while, the garbage collector will halt the whole JVM. This is always true for the NXT. But the Oracle JVM used on the EV3 uses concurrent garbage collectors. However, in the worst case, even those fall back to halting the whole JVM. The trick to avoid that is to reuse object, arrays, and such stuff as far as possible in performance critical code paths.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;how much memory on the NXT is left over for my &quot;user-level&quot; programs and data after the language-support infrastructure libraries are loaded&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This post for the LeJOS discuses this with regards to Java: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lejos.org/nxt/nxj/tutorial/AdvancedTopics/UnderstandingFilesLCPMemTools.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.lejos.org/nxt/nxj/tutorial/AdvancedTopics/UnderstandingFilesLCPMemTools.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The NXT has 256kb of flash memory. A fixed section at the start of the flash memory is allocated to the system. It is used to hold the firmware, followed by the startup menu. The rest of this system area is unused. The size of the system area varies between releases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The firmware is written in C, with some ARM assembly language. The startup menu is written in Java (in the startup project in SVN).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Flash memory is read and written in 256-byte pages. The first page after the system area is used for persistent system settings administered by the startup menu.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rest of the flash memory is used for the user file system. The first two pages hold the file table (directory), and the rest of the pages hold user files. Files are held as a contiguous set of bytes – i.e they use a single range of page numbers with no gaps. This allows a file to be addressed as a region of memory.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;do any of these alternatives support interrupt handlers&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One way of programming interrupt handlers on the NXT is to program at a lower level: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tau.ac.il/~stoledo/lego/nxt-native/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.tau.ac.il/~stoledo/lego/nxt-native/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's pretty easy to get started. You need two tools: the GNU development tools for ARM processors, and some way to download the resulting programs to the NXT. I use nexttool to download programs to the NXT, but I suppose that you could use NXT-G as well. There are several distributions of the GNU tools for ARM around. I usually use a distribution called WinARM, which is for windows; GNUARM and YAGARTO are two other options (I have used GNUARM on Linux).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="925" LastEditorUserId="925" LastEditDate="2013-11-13T15:53:33.973" LastActivityDate="2013-11-13T15:53:33.973" CommentCount="2" />

When you push a standard pushbutton, it actually makes and breaks contact many times very quickly for a few microseconds, usually enough to make the processor detect between 10 and 100 pushes, or more. There are many different methods of &quot;debouncing&quot; a pushbutton. The easiest approach is to add a small delay in your code right after you check if the pushbutton is pressed:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if(buttonState == HIGH){&#xA;    delay(10);&#xA;    //turn the light on, etc. &#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are other methods, both hardware and software. The most elegant method which will not interrupt the running of other code is to have a timer that scans the pushbutton periodically (i.e. every 5 milliseconds or so), and sets a boolean variable to TRUE when it detects a push. You could also rig up a small capacitor to the button; the schematic is available on the internet. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="176" LastActivityDate="2013-11-14T22:12:56.060" CommentCount="1" />

However, I disagree with his statement that the most elegant solution is polling. Polling is very inefficient for the task of counting how many times a button was pressed, and so I decided to post my own answer for clarification:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interrupts are what you want. Polling is used when you want to constantly capture information, for example from a range sensor. Interrupts give you time sensitive control, and only performs processing at the exact time you need it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a more thorough answer...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This design problem is commonly referred to as &quot;switch debouncing.&quot; As Chris correctly mentions, you can do this in hardware or software. The optimal method of implementation with respect to count accuracy and CPU load is to use hardware to smooth out the signal and connect your button to an interrupt pin on the Arduino. You can then use the built in attachInterrupt() function to eliminate the need to poll constantly. Polling is a waste of CPU power. The attachInterrupt() function will assign an interrupt handler that will be called whenever the interrupt pin sees a RISING or FALLING edge (this depends on how you have your switch electrically connected), or even more generally on a CHANGE. This would look similar to the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;attachInterrupt(0, buttonHandler, RISING);&#xA;&#xA;void buttonHandler() {&#xA;   // turn LED on:    &#xA;  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); &#xA;  count = count + 1;  &#xA;  Serial.print(count);&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This page explains the problem of switch debouncing and shows some example hardware circuits you can easily implement: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elexp.com/t_bounc.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.elexp.com/t_bounc.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note: You probably won't be able to see the led go HIGH because it will be handled so quickly. This code will increment the count once every time the button is pressed or released, depending on whether you attach the interrupt to the rising or falling edge of the signal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edit for OP's comment:&#xA;If you want the serial.print to say that the button is pressed the entire time, then add a while loop in the interrupt:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void buttonHandler() {&#xA;   // turn LED on:    &#xA;  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); &#xA;  count = count + 1;&#xA;  Serial.print(count);&#xA;  while(digitalRead(buttonPin)) //This will loop until the button is released&#xA;    Serial.print(&quot;ON&quot;);&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please note that this will cause your program to stay inside the interrupt handler, and your main function will not execute. In your main function, you can then have a Serial.print(&quot;OFF&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may also be able to use a boolean that is set to true in your interrupt handler:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void buttonHandler() {&#xA;   // turn LED on:    &#xA;  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); &#xA;  count = count + 1;  &#xA;  Serial.print(count);&#xA;  buttonWasPressed = true;&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That way, in your main you can have an if statement to prevent your code from having to loop in the interrupt handler:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void loop() {&#xA;  if(buttonWasPressed) {&#xA;    while(digitalRead(buttonPin)) {&#xA;      Serial.print(&quot;ON&quot;);&#xA;    }&#xA;    buttonWasPressed = false;&#xA;  }&#xA;  else&#xA;    Serial.print(&quot;OFF&quot;);&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1960" LastEditorUserId="1960" LastEditDate="2013-11-20T16:47:28.790" LastActivityDate="2013-11-20T16:47:28.790" CommentCount="3" />

An example is when you use a switching converter to step a voltage up/down. If the converter has built in over current protection (and no slow start feature), the short-circuit caused by the uncharged caps will cause the converter to stagger (starting up, over current and starting up again), and never fully reach its target voltage. However, since you're running directly from a battery this shouldn't be a problem, since a battery can be driven way above it's rated current capacity (for short periods).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another thing to also remember is that since there exists a large energy store across your power rails (the capacitors), the system might take a while to discharge (after being powered off). In other words, your Pi will probably run for another 30 seconds (depending on how much capacitance you add) or so after you disconnect your main battery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, always try to add capacitors that's rated at at least twice your operating voltage (for instance, if you have 6V batteries try to get 16V caps). Motors that reverses their direction very quickly may induce sufficiently large voltage spikes back into your system, and cause your caps to explode (hopefully your motor driver has sufficient clamping diodes).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would say a single 1000 uF electrolytic cap would be more than enough decoupling. If your Pi continues to brown-out, I guess the more appropriate cause would be your batteries not being able to supply the required current. Remember, the reason you Pi is restarting (or browning out) is due to the supply voltage dipping because the batteries are unable to supply the current the motors require. Adding capacitors will help with surges in currents (such as motors accelerating), but obviously won't solve long term high current draw.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1775" LastEditorUserId="1775" LastEditDate="2013-11-15T13:58:24.847" LastActivityDate="2013-11-15T13:58:24.847" CommentCount="4" />

This is due to the fact that batteries have internal resistance (a.k.a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Output_impedance#Batteries&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;output impedance&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/o8c50.png&quot; alt=&quot;internal resistance&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this example, if the load drops to $0.2\Omega$, the internal resistance of the battery will cause the output voltage to be divided equally with the external resistance -- the load will only see 5V.  It's possible that your 6V supply is dropping to 3V (or less) under load, in much the same way.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A capacitor will delay this effect, but what you really need is a voltage regulator -- many are available in an integrated circuit (IC) package.  Some voltage regulators will step up voltage when insufficient, but most simply lower a supply voltage to the voltage needed by a component like your RPi (in which case, your battery voltage would have to be increased so that it never dipped below 5V under full motor load).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you could use a separate battery pack for the RPi.

We are using NXT+Tetrix.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since this could damage a powered servo working against this forced position (servo holding arm weight on fixed base is now trying to move heavy base relative to fixed arm), we are thinking about somehow de-powering our servos (or servo controller), in order to get the servos to &quot;relax&quot; and accept the mechanically-forced position.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Originally, we were thinking of having our RobotC code determine the physical position of a given servo and set its desired position to there every loop, limiting how much a servo would try to fight the movement, but to our dismay, &lt;code&gt;ServoValue[fooServo]&lt;/code&gt; actually gives us the setpoint, and not the physical location (due to the servo being unable to provide this information).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We also considered setting &lt;code&gt;ServoChangeRate[fooServo]&lt;/code&gt; to 1(the minimal value) but this only changes the rate of the target location changing relative to the previous target.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, we're concluding that the only way to really do this is to fully depower the servos.

This is one of the main reasons for using a particle filter in the first place. Importance sampling does not sample from the estimated distribution, but from your set of weighted samples.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This includes the ones in your linked paper. All the references to variance in there speak of the variance which is introduced by that particular re-sampling scheme. It is a measure on the quality of the re-sampling, since you do not want to introduce unnecessary uncertainty in your estimate of the true distribution by the particles. You do not need to calculate the variances of your particles for the re-sampling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the question which one work best? Your paper has some of the answers. I also made a &lt;a href=&quot;http://robotics.stackexchange.com/a/484/127&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on the subject using less maths. In most cases some form of stratified resampling will be better than the multinomial scheme. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only case I could think of where you would need to calculate the variance of your SO(3) distribution as well would be when you wanted to verify the variance your resampling introduces. In that case, what I would do is to calculate the mean of the orientation (as you said, not trivial), and then use the variance of differences to the mean as scaled axis of rotation representation. But as I said. I don't think you need this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One word of caution: sampling over the full 6D pose is in most cases not recommended. You need a serious amount of particles for this. Even if you needed only 10 particles per dimension to represent your distribution appropriately - which often is not enough - this could mean that you need up to one million particles in 6D.

Without loss of generality, let's always assume $i=1, p_1 &amp;lt; \frac{1}{n}$, and consider the probability of the first particle not being selected (you can always re-index the particles to see this is valid for all $i$). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order for the first particle not to be selected, there need to be two equally spaced points $\{u_j, u_{j+1}, | j = 0 \dots n-1\}$ such that $u_j &amp;lt; 0$ and $u_{j+1} &amp;gt; p_1$. The probability of this event happening for $j=0$ is equal to $\frac{1}{n}-p_1$ (consider the ring interval $[1-\frac{1}{n}+p_1, 1)$). The probability of the first particle not to be selected, is a combination of $n$ exclusive events $j=0, \dots n-1$.

Left/right side provides ±1g on Y axis and nose down/up provides ±1g on X axis. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now for every orientation, I've passed the raw sensor data through a LPF and then computed the mean, median and SD of this sensor data over 100 iterations. I store this mean, median and SD value in the EEPROM for each axis (one for +1g and one for 0g).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, when I use the sensor, I load the stats from the EEPROM, match the mean/median and standard deviation with the current reading of 4/5 iterations. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here I'm working under the assumption that the values between 0g and +1g (and anything above 1g) can be interpolated/extrapolated from the data using a linear plot. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is this the correct approach for calibration?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Can you suggest a better way?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I noticed that the maxima/minima for each axis is different.

Apparently our propagation was very accurate as we haven't yet introduced noise into the system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the motion model we are using the following matrix for F:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$F = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; -v*\Delta t*sin(\theta)  &#xA;\\ 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; v*\Delta t*cos(\theta)   &#xA;\\ 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &#xA;\end{bmatrix}$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As its the Jacobian of our update formulas.

This is a very complicated project to attempt for multiple reasons. I'll try to break down these challenges. For documentation, the datasheet has all the information that you need, but there is probably not any code available that is ready to use. Sparkfun has recently introduced a 'degree of difficulty' rating for parts, and from what I can discern just using the camera is beyond your current skill level. This doesn't mean you can't do the project, but you will be learning a lot along the way :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To break this project down, you have a few challenges. First, you have a I2C &lt;em&gt;control&lt;/em&gt; interface, and a &lt;em&gt;parallel&lt;/em&gt; data output. There are a few other pins, such as the various power supplies required and the CLK, Hsync, and Vsync pins. The I/O connections aren't too complicated, but there are two different power supply domains (1.5V and 2.8V that you need &lt;em&gt;in addition to&lt;/em&gt; your Arduino supply.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you have the circuit connected electrically, then you need to implement the camera control codes. This will allow you to at least set the resolution and FPS on the camera, and probably control when the camera captures images.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then you need to transfer the image data from the camera to your microcontroller. This is done as parallel data transferred one byte at a time, and the entire sensor is row/column scanned to output the image as raw data. This means that you need at least as much RAM as the resolution of the image you are receiving. Also, the minimum transfer rate listed in the datasheet is basically 12 MBytes / sec, which is probably difficult to implement with a regular Arduino. The RAM required per frame ranges from 7MByte for full resolution, down to &#xA;25kByte for the subQCIF resolution. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you have an image in memory, then you need to encode each frame into some video format because even at the lowest bitrate you will be recording 370kByte/sec as a raw data. Video encoding is probably very difficult to do on an Arduino (or without a video encoding library and/or core). Encoding will require additional RAM on the device, and will vary depending on the codec you use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you have encoded the video into some format, you will need to transfer it to the SD card. Again, video takes a lot of bandwidth, and it is unlikely that an Arduino will be able to interface with a SD card in a way that will provide enough bandwidth for transferring video in real-time. (AFAIK, most Arduinos access SD cards through the SPI interface - this will be very slow compared to what you need).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All in all, there are a lot of challenges to recording video from a raw sensor.

To do that you need some communication between the processing unit (PC/RPi/Other microcontroller) and your robot. A low-cost solution for this is to use cheap Bluetooth modules (search ebay for 'Serial Bluetooth Module', they should't cost more than $5). On the robot side you will need a microcontroller as well since you need to receive the data from the Bluetooth, process it and convert it to control signals for the motors. Additionally, the same microcontroller will be responsible for reading the sensors and transmitting the data back to the remote processing unit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second approach is to have a single processing unit which is located on the robot. The same controller will read the sensors, provide the intelligence and control the motors. Because the robot you describe it simple, this controller could be implemented on simple microcontroller. You can create your own controller (using PIC/AVR/ARM) or you can use a ready solution like an Arduino, BasicStamp etc. Optionally you can have Bluetooth connection with a PC for telemetry (observing the sensors values and/or manually controlling the robot).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For your project, the second approach seems more appealing. It will cost much less and robots will react faster since the processing is done directly on the robot. Also since the first approach requires a processing unit on the robot as well it seems like an overkill to use a second unit for processing. On the other hand, the first approach allows you to develop your robot controller in a higher level system (PC/RPi) which depending on your experience, may be a more comfortable environment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1445" LastEditorUserId="1445" LastEditDate="2013-12-18T18:57:11.870" LastActivityDate="2013-12-18T18:57:11.870" CommentCount="4" />

Actually, it is still a PD controller with the integral gain set to zero. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's how I'm writing the angles to the servo:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;motor1.write((int)(val + (kP * pError1) +(kI * iError1) +(kD * dError1)));  //front left&#xA;motor2.write((int)(val + (kP * pError2) +(kI * iError2) +(kD * dError2)));  //rear right&#xA;motor3.write((int)(val + (kP * pError3) +(kI * iError3) +(kD * dError3)));  //front right&#xA;motor4.write((int)(val + (kP * pError4) +(kI * iError4) +(kD * dError4)));  //rear left &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;kI is zero, so I'll ignore that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the value of kP set somewhere between 0.00051 to 0.00070, I'm getting an oscillation of steady amplitude around a supposed mean value. But the problem is, the amplitude of oscillation is way too high. It is somewhere around +/- 160 degrees, which looks crazy even on a tightly constrained test rig. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[  &lt;strong&gt;Edit 2:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;How I calculate the term 'pError'&lt;/em&gt; - Simple linear thresholding. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've a precomputed data of the average readings (mean and SD) coming out of the gyro when the IMU is steady. Based on the gyro reading, I classify any motion of the setup as left, right, forward or backward. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For each of these motion, I increase the pError term for two of the motors, i.e, for right tilt, I add pError terms to motors 2 &amp;amp; 3, for left tilt, I add pError term to motors 1 &amp;amp; 4 etc. (check the comment lines in the code snippet given above). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The magnitude of error I assign to the pError term is = &lt;em&gt;abs(current gyro reading) - abs(mean steady-state gyro reading)&lt;/em&gt;. This value is always positive, therefore the side that is dipping downwards will always have a positive increment in RPM.  ]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I crank up the derivative gain to around 0.0010 to 0.0015, the oscillation dampens rapidly and the drone comes to a relatively stable attitude hold, but not on the horizontal plane. The oscillation dies down (considerably, but not completely) only to give me a stable quadrotor tilted at 90 - 100 degrees with horizontal. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm using only the gyros for calculating the error. The gyros were self calibrated, hence I do expect a fair amount of noise and inaccuracy associated with the error values. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do you think that is the primary reason for the high amplitude&#xA;oscillation?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One other probable reason might be the low update frequency of the errors. I'm updating the errors 6 times a second. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Could that be a probable reason it is taking longer to stabilise the&#xA;error?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And, for the steady state error after the wild oscillations dampen, is it necessary to fine tune the integral gain to get rid of that?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please help.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 3:&lt;/strong&gt;  I cranked up the frequency of operation to 150+ Hz and what I get now is a very controlled oscillation (within +/- 10 degrees). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm yet to tune the derivative gain, following which I plan to recompute the errors for the integral gain using a combination of gyro and accelerometer data. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 4:&lt;/strong&gt;  I've tuned the P and D gain, resulting in +/- 5 degrees oscillation(approx). I can't get it to any lower than this, no matter how much I try.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two challenges about which I'm deeply concerned:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After 5 to 8 seconds of flight, the quadcopter is leaning into one side, albeit slowly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A) Can this drift be controlled by tuning the integral gain?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;B) Can the drift be controlled by using accelerometer + gyro fused data?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;C) Given that my drone still shows +/- 5 degrees oscillation, can I consider this the optimal set point for the proportional and derivative gains?

BUT, that is made by a controller, the motor just has the sensors to provide the signals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Brushed-motors&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, these motors have a rotating part that is energized (major part is the rotor), and to energize it brushes are used. &lt;strong&gt;There's many types of brushed-motors&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can do its commutation mechanically, in the brushes, what generates sparks, less efficiency, EMI and RFI and more brush wear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can do the switching externally, and the brushes runs on continuous ring of contact, their only function is to supply power, the commutation is done by a controller.&#xA;There's nearly no sparks at the brushes (although as the ring wear this can led to bumps of the brush in the ring what result in sparks).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Their stator can be of magnets (normally the motor found on toys), or can be coils too (electro-magnets) as the motors found in power-tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Right_Motor_Internal.JPG/180px-Right_Motor_Internal.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Four brushes motor, showing its brushes and contact ring, and the mechanical commutation.

Normally the magnets have high force to power ratio, see Neodymium magnets for example, and so the rotor&lt;sup&gt;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; has low mass and consequently low inertia. That said, it can start and stop at higher rates/accelerations than other motors with less wear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stepper-motors&lt;/strong&gt; are a type of brush-less motor, but with more poles, that means that applying power to the correct phase you can &lt;em&gt;presume&lt;/em&gt; the position of the rotor&lt;sup&gt;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But the rotor can &lt;em&gt;slip&lt;/em&gt;, called &quot;lose step&quot;, and so you lost the position synchronism. That means that if use a stepper motor for precise positioning you need to be sure that the motor can handle the load and not slip. How can you be sure of the position? Put a position sensor on the axle of the motor, this with a controller turns it into a servo-motor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Stepper_motor.jpg/320px-Stepper_motor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stepper motor partially open.

Some steppers have round rotors, but the rotor is still magnetized with a high number of poles.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As they don't have brushes, normally the only mechanical contact between rotor and stator are the bearings.

A DC brush-less non-stepper motor, with 3 poles for example, would give you 120° of precision, but what you do is modulate the power applied to each coil (ex: less power to one more to the other) so that you get the positions between. That is used on some steppers motors to, and is called micro-stepping.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3 - although major times that means spark free, one possible mean of spark is from static energy on the rotor, that sometimes find the bearings as the short circuit to discharge, resulting in wear to the bearing, but that in not so common and have some means of counter-measure.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is only a small list of electrical motors types.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Mechanical transmission&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: You called that gearing but it's not the only way to do it. I will refer to mechanical transmission&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That is other topic. Motors run efficiently and have more torque at certain rotations, so you put for example a reducing transmission and get less speed and more torque.&#xA;Suppose a motor spin at 4000 RPM and have a 0.1Kg-cm of torque, assuming a reduction of 100:1 (that is 100 turn in the input result in 1 turn at the output) you should get 400 RPM and 1Kg-cm of torque.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1 - This is a theoretical example, the transmissions are not 100% efficiently so you lose some power&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Some types of transmissions that can have different ratios&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Gears, Hydraulics, chain sprocket, belts. There's more of course, and each of that have their subtypes.

However, a few common ones for hobby robots include:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Servo motor&lt;/strong&gt;: This type of motor takes input from a PWM signal, and orients itself to a specific direction based on the signal.  These tend to contain internal gears, so they do not have a high free speed.  Also, torque on such motors tends to be lower than their non-servo counterparts.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous rotation servo&lt;/strong&gt;: Like the above, but the PWM signal controls speed instead of direction.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brushed motor&lt;/strong&gt;: This is the basic type of motor you will often see in toys, etc.  Motor power is controlled via the voltage across the input lines, not via PWM.  You often need a motor controller to interface your robot with one of these.  These often spin at very high RPM, and need external gearing (or a &quot;gearhead&quot; package) to reduce them to a usable level.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brushless motor&lt;/strong&gt;: I'm not too familiar with these, but they are similar to the brushed motor above.  Because of the lack of brushes, there is less (or none--not sure) internal sparking in the motor; this can be useful when operating in certain environments where small sparks can start fires.  These, too, also spin at high rates of speed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stepper motors&lt;/strong&gt;: These operate by turning on/off magnets positioned around the motor.

To sum up my long answer below,  robotics startups are &lt;i&gt;slower, more expensive, and often more distributed in location&lt;/i&gt; than their more famous software counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Robotics or hardware startups do have a lab for design. It holds owned or rented equipment:  3D printers, machine shop lathes and drills, soldering stations and power supplies, and ONLY 1 really nice oscilloscope that everyone has to share. All the engineers will have a laptop- they may often share licenses for the expensive software like MATLAB and SolidWorks. They work outside the lab whenever possible, because the lab has no windows. Sometimes they make work from home. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main Engineering work of a robotics startup is to go from a prototype to product. Signs of a prototype that needs to be commercialized include pieces made from&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Arduino boards&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;RC Hobbyist servos and batteries&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cardboard&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;duct-tape &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;80/20 framework&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Legos&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;3D printed parts&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hand machined metal parts&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These parts, for reasons of cost and scaleability and reliability, must be replaced with custom molded plastic, metal, composites, cheaper PCBs, standardized fasteners, and consumer grade batteries and power supply electronics. This process is months to years long and uses at least 3 engineering disciplines. It's very expensive. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the Sales and Marketing and Finance employees (and also Engineering employees if the company is any good) are working to move from an &lt;i&gt;idea&lt;/i&gt; to a &lt;i&gt;business&lt;/i&gt;. This selling and fundraising is where the money to do the Engineering work comes from.  You'll notice that Anki site you linked to is billing the product as a toy, not as a military transport robot. This seems obvious, but it has significant engineering implications for what your robot will be expected to do, how long it will last, and how much you can sell it for. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All these people are busily burning up money, sometimes to the tune of  millions of dollars. To fight some of this battle, most robotics companies outsource A LOT to consultants and contractors: a consultant might build your website, design your business cards, redesign your plastic shell to be injection molded instead of 3D printed,  test your power supplies for safety, and write your user manual. You should NOT outsource complaints handling and tech support initially, because if you do, you'll lose a lot of valuable information about your first products.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a startup, once you are actually ready to produce a product (Double check- if there are still pieces of your robot made from the bullet list above, then you aren't ready), you will probably hire a Contract Manufacturer to make your first robots because you can't afford all the equipment or employees to make them yourself. You will pay them to follow your instructions to make your robot and test units before they are sold. You will discover, over the course of several months and dozens of angry user phone calls, that your written instructions weren't clear enough and robots have shipped broken. You will fix it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your coworkers and consultants and contractors are located all over the country and world, not in your lab. In the case of suppliers and contract manufacturers, someone at your company is paid to visit them and audit their work, and report the results back. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All this costs more time and money than the stereotypical software startup. It rarely includes extra money for Silicon-Valley-style perks such as gyms and gourmet smoothies[1].  The logistics of a robotics startup are close to insanity. The payoff margins are smaller than software, and the costs are higher. About the only good news is that no one can bit-torrent your robot for free, and because it is so hard to build a sustainable robot business, there are fewer people willing to fight the battle. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, I get to say I design robots for a living, and that's worth a LOT. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;-Crazy System Engineer apologizes for long answer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note 1:  The perk of free coffee IS included.

One school of thought is that collision avoidance is different from path planning, because in high level path planning you can assume that you have complete knowledge of the other aircraft or obstacles that&#xA;you are avoiding. In collision avoidance you&#xA;are limited by the sensors available. The levels of mission planning are shown in the Figure:- &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/UrJBA.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Planning Hierarchy with Spatial Decomposition&lt;/a&gt;, collision avoidance is most&#xA;applicable to the safety or low level trajectory planning. Also shown in this figure&#xA;are the time requirements for data from each&#xA;of the systems. Collision avoidance is the&#xA;point at which, if you do not alter course&#xA;you will crash. The two places where this&#xA;can be observed are in controlled airspace&#xA;within the terminal region (airports) and where&#xA;the airways intersect. Rules of the Air dictate a set of rules, which if followed prevent this happening. Pilots are not very&#xA;good at see-and avoid as they are required&#xA;to perform stability and control, communications and high level mission planning. This&#xA;means that collisions are not detected as early&#xA;as they should be and then become a critical last second maneuver.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In large aircraft, Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) is used to make the pilots aware of&#xA;where approaching aircraft are. TCAS is a co-operative system, which works on the assumption&#xA;that both aircraft will have TCAS. If only one aircraft has TCAS, for example a large aircraft &#xA;flying&#xA;towards a micro-light, a collision will occur. The large aircraft may turn in one direction, and the&#xA;micro-light (who has had no communication with the aircraft) may turn in the same direction. As&#xA;mentioned above the issue is with small aircraft, which are unable to carry the large, power hungry&#xA;TCAS systems. Larger gliders carry a FLARM system (The name is inspired from Flight Alarm),&#xA;which broadcasts its own position and speed vector; but this does not communicate with TCAS, it&#xA;just senses the approaching aircraft (only it has FLARM also, leaving the same problem mentioned&#xA;with the micro-light).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These systems, which will be on most aircraft in the next ten to fifteen years, have in&#xA;influenced many experts in this field, to assume that the position of all aircraft within the operating area will be known. Though it should be noted that, whilst this would be a logical conclusion to draw in controlled airspace, in uncontrolled airspace this cannot be definitively said, because it does not account for the aforementioned small aircraft that are unable to carry such systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order to deal with the situations described above in uncontrolled airspace there are three types&#xA;of collision detection sensors:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cooperative : That tell you where they are (e.g. ADS-B)  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Passive : Take data in (e.g. Camera's)  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Active : Send out signals to receive&#xA;information back (e.g. Radar/Sonar or Lasers)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the sensor data is acquired, in order to work out where to go, the sensor data is analysed&#xA;using Collision Avoidance Algorithms:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Potential Fields : Real time obstacle avoidance method. `Robot&#xA;motion can be considered as a particle that moves in a gradient&#xA;vector field generated by positive and negative electric particles'&#xA;The advantage is that it is simple. The disadvantage is the local&#xA;minima condition where the robot can get stuck between two walls or&#xA;obstacles.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vortex Potential Field : In order to reduce the problem of the local minima, a vortex can be added to the potential field, the disadvantage of this is that it forces the vehicle one way round the obstacle and this can lead to a sub-optimal path.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bug Algorithms : Simple to find optimal leave points, the 'simplicity    of these algorithms leads to a number of shortcomings. None of these    algorithms take into account robot kinematics which is a severe    limitation.'&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Roadmap : Captures the connectivity of the robots free space into one&#xA;dimensional curves 'If more than one continuous paths can be found,&#xA;the shortest patch might be selected according to Dijstra's algorithm&#xA;or the A* algorithm' Drawbacks are `time and storage complexities&#xA;when the environment is complex'&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;3D Geometric : 'does not require the solution of any programming&#xA;problem, thus resulting suitable for real time applications'&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Azimuth Approach : Using passive camera video feeds and image&#xA;processing techniques to spot the aircraft and detects a collision&#xA;based on change in azimuth angle. This method can be very processor&#xA;intensive.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Collision Cone : Transforms the velocities of both aircraft into&#xA;relative velocities. A safety region is drawn around the obstacle&#xA;aircraft and a cone is used to connect the region to the avoiding&#xA;aircraft. A potential collision is detected when the relative&#xA;velocities are within the cone.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A number of path planning algorithms have been discussed in the other answers so I will not repeat them here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion you need to fully understand the problem you are dealing with before you can design a collision avoidance algorithm or path planning algorithm to suit the purpose. Many collision avoidance algorithms and path planning algorithms are compared using a simple bicycle model which may or may not be representative of your final application. If the model is not representative then its like tuning a controller for one system then implementing it on another.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="925" LastActivityDate="2014-01-02T11:56:18.640" />

Pointers to other educational resources are appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, I started developing a basic navigation algorithm for moving in unexplored areas, similar to what &lt;strong&gt;Cube&lt;/strong&gt; suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The priority for me is as few moves as possible, as it costs time and fuel cells for each additional move (approx. 0.8 seconds and 1 fuel cell per move in either direction). I plan on using the Euclidean heuristics function in a Greedy Best-First Search for computing a path that is expected to be quite optimal in reducing the number of moves to reach the goal, if enough data is available from the shared database from previous exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each time an obstacle is reached, I plan to use the following very basic algorithm, exploiting the fact that Turtles are able to move vertically:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. Calculate direct horizontal path to the goal.&#xA;2. Turn to the direction of the next step of the path.&#xA;3. If an obstacle is detected in front of the Turtle go to 5. If this is the 4th time that an obstacle is detected in front of the Turtle after moving up, go to 6.&#xA;4. Move forward, go to 2.&#xA;5. If no obstacle is detected above the Turtle, move up and go to 3, else go to 7.&#xA;6. Backtrack to the coordinates the Turtle was in before moving upwards.&#xA;7. Turn left, go to 3.&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When using this algorithm, records are kept of the explored coordinates and uploaded to a shared database. However, there are some cases, that I did not consider:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- When should it move down?&#xA;- What if the goal is not reachable from a coordinate directly above it?&#xA;- If no horizontal move in any direction is possible, how long should it backtrack?&#xA;- How to detect unreachable goals (obstacles can then be removed if requested)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe if enough exploration data of the area is available, a Jump Point Search is performed to calculate an optimal path. However this assumes a 2D map. How can I take the 3rd dimension into account?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, what would be a good data structure to store the exploration data?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2522" LastEditorUserId="2522" LastEditDate="2014-01-05T19:35:17.073" LastActivityDate="2014-01-05T19:35:17.073" Title="ComputerCraft (Minecraft mod) navigation: Collision avoidance and path planning/finding in 2D/3D space" Tags="&lt;mobile-robot&gt;&lt;navigation&gt;" AnswerCount="3" CommentCount="3" FavoriteCount="1" />

I concur that passive vision-based techniques will require a huge amount of engineering to implement, not to mention substantial size, weight, and power.  I recommend using differential GPS techniques -- not exactly easy, but simpler from a system standpoint.  You will need a high-update rate GPS receiver that outputs Carrier Phase and Pseudo-Range data as well as a traditional GPS solution.  You will also need to transmit this additional data to your quadcopter from both a nearby reference station and the moving object.  It is useful to have a stationary reference station since its position is exactly known, so using the satellite ephemeris you can determine the propagation and timing errors from each satellite very precisely.  Since you know the approximate geometry to both the non-moving reference station and the moving object, and the paths to the satellites are approximately the same for both cases, you can adopt the precisely calculated propagation and timing errors learned from the reference station and apply them to the moving object.  Additional accuracy is gained by computing a relative position solution for both the quadcopter and the moving object that explains the observed changes in Carrier Phase over time as both of these move.  Since these are phase changes, the integer number of cycles is unknown and must be solved for using a well-known technique for finding integer solutions to least-square problems (name escapes me at the moment).  A Kalman Filter or Particle Filter is also typically needed to converge to the correct position solution using the carrier data after fusing with the pseudo-range-derived data.

This of course does not give you the desired angular positions about which you asked. Assuming the user expects the quadcopter to hover once it has reached the specified desired position $\mathbf{p} = [X, Y, Z]^T$ then we need $\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{r} = \mathbf{w} = \left[ \begin{matrix} 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 \end{matrix} \right]^T$ for the final state.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However that still does not give you the desired angles to transition between the initial state $\mathbf{x}_i$ and the final state $\mathbf{x}_f = \left[ \begin{matrix} \mathbf{p} &amp;amp; \mathbf{v} &amp;amp; \mathbf{r} &amp;amp; \mathbf{w} \end{matrix} \right]^T$.

Instead, they measure the change in position so as to prevent the quadrotor from moving when it should not.

As such the data from the accelerometer is usually combined with other sources of information. The Kalman filter is one approach as the presenter touches on around minute 27. Another is to use a complimentary filter which are nice because they require less processing power. Some of the other sources for data for estimating the state of a quadcopter include the gyroscopes, magnometers, barometric pressure sensors, range finders (usually ultrasonic though I have seen IR sensors used), and optical flow via cameras.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With this additional information you could arguably still use an accelerometer for position estimation.

Open-loop approach should be easier although it will be highly inaccurate. The closed-loop is more complex but it should improve the accuracy. The decision depends on your application and how much time you can spend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The robot has to follow a requested path drawn by the user. To do that, you &lt;strong&gt;first&lt;/strong&gt; need to track the position and orientation (state) of the robot. In the open-loop approach this is done by blindly predicting the state of the robot based on the input. So for example if you know that the robot is positioned at (0,0) facing at 0 degrees, and the input in the wheels is the same (i.e. drives &quot;straight&quot;) at 1 meter per second, you would expect that after a second, the state of the robot will be (1,0) and still facing at 0 degrees (in reality this wont be the case because of uncertainties but it is just a rough estimation). This is usually done based on a mathematical model of the robot.  For the close-loop approach you also use feedback from the robot. One way to do this is with odometry, i.e. measuring the distance traveled by each wheel and therefore estimating its state using a model, for example the Kinematic Model. State estimation is improved, since you have the model (as in the open-loop) to &quot;predict&quot; the state and then you have the feedback to correct that prediction. For later reference lets define the state estimation as $\hat{x}$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The closed-loop approach is certainly more accurate but it mainly depends on what sensors you use. An odometry based estimation will be acceptable for short periods but after that it will diverge and be useless. As always, this depends on your application and tolerance for accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The second step&lt;/strong&gt; is to decide what input is required to send to the motor. This decision is made based on where the robot is i.e. $\hat{x}$ and where it needs to go $x_r$. For this you need a controller that constantly tries to minimize the error $e=\hat{x}-x_r$. So for your example, $x_r$ holds the coordinates of the next point that has to be visited by the robot. A simple controller would be one that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Rotates the robot until it faces the point $x_r$&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Moves the robot in a straight line until it reaches the point&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Load the next point in $x_r$ and go to the first step&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are of course more sophisticated controllers which have certain properties but the above should work for your application.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1445" LastActivityDate="2014-01-10T13:55:16.753" CommentCount="7" />

When a plane or helicopter is close to the surface, the aerodynamics change. This distance is usually considered to be the same as wingspan, or rotor diameter for a helicopter. The lift/drag ratios change, the thrust efficiency changes, and the balance can be affected because you are moving on or off a bubble of pressurized air. Also the turbulence can go nuts, placing high demands on the control systems.

So now you tried a PID control based straight off the raw IMU data.  Tha't better but you are going to need one more step between the two.   Will I say this assuming you are using a low-cost IMU, the kind that just breaks out the chip.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First off it would be ideal if you could measure the speed of each motor, and not just assume it rotates at a speed proportionate to the commanded value.  Likely it does not.  The BEST way to to place an encoder on the motor shaft that sends a few pluses per revolution.  Then you replace &quot;motor2.write(val)&quot; with something like &quot;motor.setspeed(rotationVelocity); and the set speed method runs a PID loop just ontheat one motor's speed, sending whatever PWM value is required.   OK, lacking an encoder, get a hand held propeller tachometer.  And plot RPM vs PWM for a tried vehicle fixed to a stand at some hight from the ground.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NEXT YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW TO RELATE RPM TO THRUST.  One problem with yourPID control is it assume PWM value (voltage) is LINEARLY related to force in the vertical direction is is NOT because &#xA;1) If the vehicle is tilted the foxed is no longer down and is smaller be the cosine of the tilt and..&#xA;2) force is NEVER linearly replaced to voltage.  It think(???) there is a cubed relationship the is power cubed = force.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might just kip all the math and measure the force as a function of PWM and make a lookup table.  Better to use encoders and&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You over all PID loop will work much better when have a linear relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next idea:  You CAN make a quad more stable.  What if you tilt the plane of each door inwards just a little.  Each is slightly non-horizonal, now if one side dips it will generate more lift.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last idea:  The IMU is a noisy device.  The accelerometer has high frequency noise on it becise of random vibrations and the gyro has drift.  The &quot;standard&quot; why to address this is with a Kalman Filter.  The math is not easy but you can find MANY examples of Kalman filters on-line.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Summary:&#xA;1) Use good filter model to correct the IMU data.  The raw data is not good.&#xA;2) Create a method (function) that takes llefting force as input then sets the PWM slue as required.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;3) Used a top layer PID to drive the error to zero&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What this does is address the basic flaw of all PID controller, they don't &quot;see&quot; inside the black box.  They don't know the gyro drift and accelerometer is noisy and that PWM has a non-linear relationship to lift.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next you get into moving flight and you need to make your aerodynamic model better to account for the fixed pitch props&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2609" LastActivityDate="2014-01-15T05:09:19.427" CommentCount="5" />

Double integration of an error make it error^2 (for a simple constant error due to bad calibration).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can suggest you to search the web for &quot;pose estimation algorithm&quot; as keywords or go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.ros.org/Sensors/Pose%20Estimation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ROS&lt;/a&gt; that maybe have something ready for your IMU.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1777" LastEditorUserId="1777" LastEditDate="2014-01-17T18:21:26.563" LastActivityDate="2014-01-17T18:21:26.563" />

The sensor should determine ($p, \theta, \phi$) from the origin  where $\theta$ is the rotation about z-axis and $\phi$ is the rotation about x-axis.
