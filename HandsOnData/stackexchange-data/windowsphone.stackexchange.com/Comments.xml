One of the first things the app says when you run it is that you have to run it every 14 days or it will stop logging your location, even if you pin it. And if an app has to tell you to do something periodically to keep it running, that's called intervention. Also, you most certainly can keep track of yourself 24/7 with a dedicated device. Anyone who has every had a real GPS (Such as a 62S) most likely has this kind of expectation when they get a &quot;smart phone&quot; with a GPS as well."
