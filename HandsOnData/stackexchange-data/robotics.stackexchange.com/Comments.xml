Real-time computing/programming is a part of computer science related to implementing and scheduling tasks that have a deadline. In particular, hard real-time tasks should _not_ miss their deadlines under any circumstances. Real-time is often mistaken for &quot;fast&quot;, which is an orthogonal concept. Closed-loop control is a very simple example of a real-time task. Dynamic program is a completely unrelated subject." CreationDate="2013-04-03T13:18:29.187" UserId="158" />

We think that the problem with our PID controller is because of these noises ... Is this a true assumption ? We can't tune our PID parameters ( using Ziegler–Nichols method ) when we have noisy data. We tested Ziegler–Nichols method when we have low rate noises and we successfully tuned our PID but when noise appears we are unable to tune PIDs. Is there anyway for us for tuning our PID in such situation ? Is this problem is because of the noises or the PID itself can get rid of them ?"

Fortunately for you, a human pressing a button isn't all that fast, and printing a single int should be fine. If you had an actuator pushing this button at 100Hz you might want to start thinking about how much time is sunk by the print statement." CreationDate="2013-11-15T16:41:45.470" UserId="1960" />
